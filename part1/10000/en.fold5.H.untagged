market , was especially hurt by a 15 % price drop , Mr. Bradford said .
The company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material , repair and maintenance , and labor costs .
The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union .
Meanwhile , the company 's service center segment , which saw operating profit drop to $ 11.5 million from $ 30.7 million a year ago , experienced much of the same demand and cost problems , as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system .
Inland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company 's short-term outlook is `` clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets . ''
However , he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels , and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter .
In the first nine months , profit was $ 113 million , or $ 3.04 a share , on sales of $ 3.19 billion , compared with $ 204.5 million , or $ 5.76 a share , on sales of $ 3.03 billion , a year earlier .
The `` seismic '' activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth .
When things are quiet -LRB- low volatility -RRB- , the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately .
However , when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure , the more `` earthquake-resistant '' it is , the better its chance for survival .
America 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully `` aftershock-resistant . ''
Investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information .
That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity .
And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks .
In today 's markets , specialists -LRB- on the New York Stock Exchange -RRB- and `` upstairs '' market makers -LRB- in the over-the-counter market -RRB- are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process .
When they halt trading , all market liquidity is gone .
And when any component of the market -- cash , futures or options -- loses liquidity , the price discovery system -LRB- the way prices are determined -RRB- becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time .
Last Friday the 13th -LRB- as well as two years ago this week -RRB- the markets became unlinked .
When that happened , `` seismic '' tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility .
Lack of important , needed information can cause fear .
Fear is the father of panic .
Panic frequently results in irrational behavior .
And in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe .
When market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at various prices -RRB- be made available to all , not just to market makers .
Because of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information .
To add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena -LRB- and the information that would automatically accompany such access -RRB- by investors -- particularly institutional investors .
Contrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole .
What market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service .
Liquidity is not a service .
It is a market attribute -- the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news .
Market makers buy what investors wish to sell ; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors , and at a profit .
As a result , while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker -LRB- which is micro-liquidity for the investor -RRB- , the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction : The unwanted position is still an unwanted position ; only the identity of the seller has changed .
In fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers -LRB- a result of some post-1987 crash studies -RRB- also increases market volatility , since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time , the more selling pressure is overhanging the market .
In an open electronic system , any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at each price -RRB- entered by dealers and investors alike , and to enter and execute orders .
Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis .
Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a `` national market system '' -LRB- not yet achieved -RRB- almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 .
Last Friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe `` aftershocks . ''
Were we smart or just lucky ?
I 'm not certain .
But I am sure we need to maximize our `` earthquake '' protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation 's markets .

NOW YOU SEE IT , now you do n't .
The recession , that is .
The economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up .
So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane .
For the past seven years , investors have had the wind at their backs , in the form of a generally growing economy .
Some may have forgotten -- and some younger ones may never have experienced -- what it 's like to invest during a recession .
Different tactics are called for , as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher .
For those investors who believe -- or fear -- that 1990 will be a recession year , many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio .
In a nutshell , pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in `` defensive '' industries .
A heavy dose of cash is prescribed , along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds .
It 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand .
But that may not be possible , because recessions often take investors by surprise .
`` They always seem to come a bit later than you expect .
When they do hit , they hit fast , '' says David A. Wyss , chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc .
Though he himself does n't expect a recession soon , Mr. Wyss advises people who do that `` the best thing to be in is long that is , 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds . ''
The reason is simple , Mr. Wyss says : `` Interest rates almost always decline during recession . ''
As surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds .
They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do .
That effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds .
But short-term bonds ca n't rise too much , because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon .
Long-term bonds , with many years left before maturity , swing more widely in price .
But not just any bonds will do .
Corporate bonds `` are usually not a good bet in a recession , '' Mr. Wyss says .
As times get tougher , investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts .
This hurts the price of corporate bonds .
Also , he notes , `` most corporate bonds are callable . ''
That means that a corporation , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value -LRB- plus , in some cases , a sweetener -RRB- .
When interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that ; they then save on interest costs .
But the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny .
If corporate bonds are bad in recessions , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all .
It 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing , says Avner Arbel , professor of finance at Cornell University .
`` Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside , and this could be a disaster . ''
Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession , but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government .
During an economic slump , local tax revenues often go down , raising the risks associated with at least some municipals .
And , like corporates , many municipal bonds are callable .
But a few experts , going against the consensus , do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing .
One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach , director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. , a brokerage house in Houston , who thinks that `` we 're either in a recession or about to go into one . ''
What 's more , he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual : `` Once the downturn comes , it 's going to be very hard to reverse . ''
Investors , he advises , `` should be cautious , '' holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds .
Because he sees `` 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy , '' he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon .
Instead , Mr. Beach says , investors `` probably should be carrying a very high level of cash , '' by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills .
Greg Confair , president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown , Pa. , also recommends that investors go heavily for cash .
He is n't sure a recession is coming , but says the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad .
`` This late in an expansion , '' the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession , Mr. Confair says .
The Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a `` soft landing , '' he says , requires the Fed to navigate `` an ever-narrowing corridor . ''
A soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all , Mr. Confair adds .
It has to be engineered over and over again , month after month .
He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles `` juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw . ''
And , in a sense , that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks -- the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios .
It comes down to a question of whether to try to `` time '' the market .
For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad , stocks have been rewarding long-term investments .
Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % , including both dividends and price appreciation .
That 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid .
Moreover , because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming , some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing .
`` Trying to time the economy is a mistake , '' says David Katz , chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York .
Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years .
Investors who listened , and lightened up on stocks , `` have just hurt themselves , '' he says .
Mr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy .
Frequent trading runs up high commission costs .
And the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time .
Still , few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming .
After all , in all five recessions since 1960 , stocks declined .
According to Ned Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis , Fla. , the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % , and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started .
By the time a recession is `` official '' -LRB- two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product -RRB- , much of the damage to stocks has already been done-and , in the typical case , the recession is already half over .
About six months before a recession ends , stocks typically begin to rise again , as investors anticipate a recovery .
The average recession lasts about a year .
Unfortunately , though , recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases .
But whatever their advice about timing , none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession .
For the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks , professionals have a number of suggestions .
Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios -- that is , low prices in relation to the company 's earnings per share .
`` Low P-E '' stocks , he says , vastly outperform others `` during a recession or bear market . ''
In good times , he says , they lag a bit , but overall they provide superior performance .
Prof. Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies .
Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession , he says .
And in any case , he argues , stocks of small companies are `` almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30 , 1987 , just before the crash . ''
For example , Mr. Arbel says , stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow .
Cash flow , basically earnings plus depreciation , is one common gauge of a company 's financial health . -RRB-
That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash , Mr. Arbel says .
And it 's way above the ratio -LRB- 7.5 times cash flow -RRB- that bigger companies are selling for .
Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in `` defensive '' industries .
Food , tobacco , drugs and utilities are the classic examples .
Recession or not , people still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they 're sick .
George Putnam III , editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston , offers one final tip for recession-wary investors .
`` Keep some money available for opportunities , '' he says .
`` If the recession does hit , there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest . ''
Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
Some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others .
The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions .
Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt .
But while the overall market improved , the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties , even as junk-bond prices rose .
Yesterday , Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it postponed a $ 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp .
And Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $ 475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night .
The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar .
Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk .
Since last week 's junk-bond market debacle , many new issues of high-yield , high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back , delayed or dropped .
On Wednesday , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to $ 71 million from $ 150 million .
Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's $ 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction .
Last week , the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock .
Prudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions .
`` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and -LCB- Chicago & North Western -RCB- is no exception , '' said Mariel Clemensen , vice president , high-yield research , at Citicorp .
Portfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals .
Dan Baldwin , managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management , said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because `` several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package .
If you 're going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra . ''
Mr. Baldwin likes the offering .
But several mutual-fund managers , nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues , said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class .
While they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good , they do n't view it as the best .
To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds , portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker .
The bonds are expected to have a 14 % coupon rate .
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10 % of the stock of CNW Corp. , Chicago & North Western 's parent company .
Donaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring .
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations , the 10 % of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group , which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5 % each .
That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 % .
Despite the problems with new issues , high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary , or resell , market .
Junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point .
In the Treasury market , the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point , or $ 8.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows .
That raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower .
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month , slightly lower than some economists had expected .
But there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys .
Short-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed , with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher .
Yesterday , the Fed executed four-day matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system .
The move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week .
The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans .
It is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes .
`` The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively .
They are telling us that -LCB- 8 % -RCB- is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate , '' said Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC .
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 to yield 7.955 % , compared with 100 to yield 8.032 % Wednesday .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 to yield 7.937 % , compared with 99 to yield 8.007 % .
Short-term rates rose yesterday .
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % .
Meanwhile , the Treasury sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday .
The average yield on the bills was 7.35 % , down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 .
Yesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 .
Here are details of the auction :
Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities .
Dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by to point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains .
Petrolane Gas Service 's 13 % debentures traded at 102 , after trading around par earlier this week , and RJR 's 13 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 after trading at below par earlier this week .
Investment-grade bonds were unchanged .
Activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market , as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector .
Traders estimated that more than $ 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers .
There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios .
According to market participants , the bonds were met with decent bids , but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield .
Away from the general obligation sector , activity was modest .
Long dollar bonds were flat to up point .
New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up at 98 bid to yield about 7.32 % , down 0.03 percentage point .
The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake , although traders said market participants remained cautious .
California expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $ 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake , according to a state official .
It 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve , said Cindy Katz , assistant director of California 's department of finance , although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated .
Meanwhile , new issuance was slow .
The largest sale in the competitive arena was a $ 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority .
A balance of $ 25.8 million remained in late order-taking , according to the lead manager .
Mortgage securities generally ended to point higher , but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts .
Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages .
Ginnie Mae 13 % securities were down about at 109 .
If the refinancing plan clears Congress , there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities , hurting any investor paying much above par for them .
In the current-coupon sector , a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings .
Ginnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 , up 9 , 9 %
% to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48 .
While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve , underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable .
Two new Remics totaling $ 900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday .
British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson .
The Treasury 11 % bond due was down at 111 to yield 10.09 % , while the 11 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 to yield 12.94 % .
In Japan , the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 , to yield 5.32 % , and in West Germany , the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % .
THE PANHANDLER approaches , makes his pitch .
It may be straightforward -- he wants money for food -- or incredibly convoluted ; his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken , he has lost his wallet and has only $ 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing $ 3.83 , and wo n't you give him the difference ?
Well , how about a loan , he 'll take your name and address . . .
Figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express , most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this .
But healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer , famine , child abuse , or what have you .
Most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals .
But will it ?
In a distressing number of cases , no .
In fact , the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler : at least he has no overhead , and he might even be telling the truth .
Last year , more than $ 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities .
While the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for , it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in `` expenses '' claimed by other operators , including fraudulent expenses .
In many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries .
It 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs , high-living operators , and downright fraud .
But the problem clearly is widespread and persistent .
State law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams , and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging .
The Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year , measuring them against minimum standards for accountability ; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation ; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established .
The Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program .
Roughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test .
Which , it should be added , does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway .
Without a microscope and a subpoena , it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself .
On this basis , `` there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one , '' says David Ormstedt , an assistant attorney general in Connecticut .
`` A lot of donors just get taken . ''
Including those , he contends , who put about $ 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center .
The state has sued these charities in state court , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; 82 % , says Mr. Ormstedt , went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats , trips to Florida , Lucullan restaurant tabs .
The telephone number for the charity in Shelton , Conn. , has been disconnected , and the former officials could n't be located .
Running a charity does cost money , but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed .
The Arthritis Foundation , the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs , not overhead .
With some other charities , however , its the other way around .
The fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society , for example , took in $ 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children .
By the time it paid its expenses it only had $ 120,000 left -- not enough to treat even one child .
The state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago , along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. , its Houston-based fund raiser .
Both deny wrongdoing .
The charity admits spending a lot on fund raising , but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come .
Michael Burns , president of Telesystems , says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case , noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's .
Meanwhile , a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds .
Enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising .
State laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead , but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court .
It has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising , which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression .
This puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently .
The attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere .
In making cases , the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers .
Illinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there .
Enforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give .
Attorneys general in several states , including Illinois , are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. , an Alexandria , Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America .
According to the Illinois attorney general 's suit , Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes , and could win up to an additional $ 1,000 on top of them , if they contributed as little as $ 7 .
But the total value of the prizes was only $ 5,000 and most `` winners '' will receive just 10 cents , according to the attorney general 's office .
The suit is still pending in Illinois state court .
Watson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court ; officials decline to comment further .
While they can target some of the most obvious miscreants , enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface .
There are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators , they say , that it is probably impossible to stop them all .
One maneuver : the `` public education '' gambit .
The solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue .
What it does n't say is that the entire `` campaign '' may be the fund-raising letter itself .
`` All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as , ` Do n't smoke ' or ` Wear suntan lotion , ' `` says William Webster , attorney general of Missouri .
`` By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations , hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters . ''
Mr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win $ 5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as $ 5 to cancer education .
`` A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages .
I think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign , but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters , '' he says .
Officials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls .
Many fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs .
The established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it .
`` We ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name .
Most of them do n't last for long , but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us , '' says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association .
And sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it .
A couple in Rockford , Ill. , raised $ 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving , without permission from the group .
MADD did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $ 613 , along with a letter saying that was the charity 's `` share . ''
The Illinois Attorney General won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without MADD 's permission .
The couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford , law enforcement officials report .
Denise McDonald , a spokeswoman for MADD , says , `` It 's scary , because anybody could do this.`` f this.`` f

British Airways PLC , a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. , washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of United Airlines .
Specifically , the British carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for UAL .
In addition , British Air officially withdrew its support for the previous $ 300-a-share bid in a terse statement that said `` the original deal is closed . ''
Company officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group , which also includes UAL 's management and pilot union , failed to obtain financing for the $ 6.79 billion transaction .
The carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for UAL .
However , company officials said they plan to take `` no initiatives '' to resurrect the transaction , and `` are n't aware '' of any restructured bid in the making .
Collectively , the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground .
The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday , with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place .
However , in response to the British Air decision , United 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out .
Pilot union Chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky said advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board `` at the earliest time possible . ''
Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air 's participation .
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement .
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf , who is leading the management end of the buy-out , has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal .
In another setback yesterday , United 's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws .
In an effort to derail the buy-out , the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Transportation Department and Labor Department .
But there was one bright spot yesterday .
The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake .
The pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . ''
Still , without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid .
Under the previous plan , British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a $ 750 million equity investment , with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL management .
British Air officials said the airline 's chairman , Lord King , was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier .
The previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer , Derek Stevens , who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week .
UAL stock dropped $ 1.625 yesterday to $ 190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
UAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement .
In an interview Wednesday with Dow Jones Professional Investor Report , Mr. Stevens said , `` We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all .
We 're not rushing into anything .
We do n't want to be party to a second rejection . ''
Indeed , British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment .
The original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution .
The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts .
`` The -LCB- buy-out -RCB- consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing , '' a British Air spokesman said .
British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest 's Airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier .
Most of the department 's statements since the Northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers .
Even before British Air 's announcement , pilot union leaders had been meeting in Chicago yesterday to consider their options .
The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul , Weiss , Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .
They also unanimously re-elected Mr. Dubinsky , the union chairman who has led the pilots ' 2 fight to take control of the airline .
UAL 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid .
They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction .
The buy-out fell through after Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. , the lead banks in the transaction , failed to obtain $ 7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan .
Italy 's industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2 % in June from a year earlier , the state statistical institute Istat said .
The June increase compared with a rise of 10.5 % in May from a year earlier .
Domestic wholesale sales rose 11.9 % from a year earlier , while foreign sales jumped 17.3 % , Istat said .
For the first six months , wholesale sales rose 12.3 % from the year before , reflecting to a 11.5 % jump in domestic sales and a 14.6 % boost in foreign sales .
Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6 % in the January-June period from a year earlier .
Sales of consumer goods rose 6.9 % in the same period , while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8 % from a year ago .
Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided , under pressure from their leaders , not to offer their own proposal , placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush 's legislative priority .
A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets .
The plan was complete except for finishing touches , and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday .
But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- , a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut , called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday .
Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist .
Afterward , leaders of the dissident Democrats relented , and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned .
The decision is a setback for President Bush , who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate .
Having a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage .
Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder .
Still , Sen. Bob Packwood -LRB- R. , Ore. -RRB- , the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment , predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year .
He said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect .
But Sen. Mitchell , buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats , strongly disagreed .
Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year .
Yesterday , in an interview , he added that the Democrats ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year . ''
Mr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week , when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision .
That vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators .
The House version of the bill does include the tax cut .
Now Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill , perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation .
To help lay the groundwork for that fight , President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue .
The president apparently will have only one bill to push , Sen. Packwood 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it .
`` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , a leader of those Democrats .
The Packwood plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year .
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years .
The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 .
As an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index .
For corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % .
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years .
The Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth -LRB- R. , Del. -RRB- , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts .
The Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses .
Current IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs , but would be subject to tax though no penalty .
Westmoreland Coal Co. , realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity , reported sharply improved third-quarter results .
The producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was $ 5.9 million , or 71 cents a share , on revenue of $ 145.4 million .
For the year-earlier period , the company reported a loss of $ 520,000 or six cents a share .
In the latest nine months , the company earned $ 8.5 million , or $ 1.03 a share .
Last year 's net loss of $ 3,524,000 included a benefit of $ 1,640,000 from an accounting change .
Revenue for the nine months rose to $ 449 million from $ 441.1 million .
In an interview , Pemberton Hutchinson , president and chief executive , cited several reasons for the improvement : higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions '' in the mines , as well as lower costs for materials , administrative overhead and debt interest .
In the latest nine months , Mr. Hutchinson said , total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier .
In addition , long-term debt has been trimmed to about $ 72 million from $ 96 million since Jan. 1 .
He predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters .
Westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region .
The operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News , Va .
Westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage , including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas .
For the past couple of years , Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business .
Marginal operations and assets have been sold .
The size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 .
About 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated .
Even perks have been reduced .
For example , the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % .
`` I think the ship is now righted , the bilges are pumped and we are on course , '' Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program .
`` Much of what we set out to do is completed . ''
But he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth , so investors `` should n't just multiply the third quarter by four '' and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained .
One difference , he said , is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season .
`` I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now , '' he said .
`` We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient .
It 's a process that never really ends . ''
Nevertheless , Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be `` solidly profitable '' for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring `` more of the same . ''
For all of 1988 , the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $ 134,000 on revenue of $ 593.5 million .
An accounting adjustment made net income $ 1.5 million , or 18 cents a share .
In a move that complements the company 's basic strategy , its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia .
Some of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines .
Mr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s `` will be exciting . ''
He said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River .
Westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s .
`` We see coal 's piece of the action growing , '' Mr. Hutchinson said .
`` Coal prices , while not skyrocketing , will grow modestly in real terms , we think .
Chase Manhattan Corp. , after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building , has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower .
Chase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970 .
The current transaction cost the bank approximately $ 140 million .
Of that amount , $ 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself .
The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers , most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in 1993 .
The move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof .
The headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza .
As part of its decision to leave the building , Chase tried to sell its interest , along with the Atlas estate 's interest , shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash .
Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations .
He said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ 400 million to $ 475 million , but did n't get an offer for more than $ 375 million .
As the building 's new owner , Chase will have its work cut out for it .
Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space , and Salomon Brothers Inc. , whose headquarters is in the building , also plans to move shortly .
In addition , another major building tenant , Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities , likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation .
New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants .
Even with its striking views of the New York harbor , the building is considered antiquated by modern office standards .
And Chase will have to spend approximately $ 50 million to remove asbestos from the premises .
WALL STREET , SHAKE hands with George Orwell .
The author of the futuristic novel `` 1984 '' invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is , anything negative about the policies and practices of the state .
Wall Street has n't gotten that far yet , but it has made a promising start .
Its language -- call it Streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous , reassuring , and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better , safer or cheaper than they really are .
When something undeniably nasty happens , a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear , much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers .
For example , we 'll bet you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago .
According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market , it never happened .
In their lexicon the 508-point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19 , 1987 , was just a big blip .
Trotting out a much-beloved Streetspeak term , New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only `` a major technical correction . ''
Another much-beloved saying , however , this one in plain English , holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it is a duck .
On Oct. 29 , 1929 -- a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word -- the DJ industrials fell 12.8 % .
In the `` technical correction '' of two years ago , they lost a whopping 22.6 % . -RRB-
Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock .
These people used to be called brokers , but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction , when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone .
Either way , the word `` broker '' is clearly out of favor .
Of the major New York-based securities firms , only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers .
At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , they are `` financial consultants . ''
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , Prudential Bache Securities , and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , they are `` account executives . ''
At PaineWebber Inc. , they are `` investment executives . ''
Such titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified , broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today 's myriad financial products .
It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves , overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle , do n't feel .
`` Its almost product de jour , '' grouses one account executive at Dean Witter .
The transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips , instead stressing such terms as `` safe , '' `` insured '' and `` guaranteed '' -- even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product .
The names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them , either .
A case in point : `` government-plus '' bond funds .
What could imply more safety than investing in government bonds ?
What could be better than getting a tad more income from them -LRB- the plus -RRB- than other people ?
Indeed , conservative investors , many of them elderly , have poured more than $ 50 billion into such funds , which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds -- only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options , a gambler 's game .
When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished , look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker .
This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships , many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments .
They are still being sold , but more and more often as `` direct investments '' -- with all the same risks they had under the old label .
In such cases , the game has n't changed , only the name .
In others a familiar old name still prevails , but the underlying game has changed .
For example , `` no load '' mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission .
Getting out of them , however , may be a different story now .
Traditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee , usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees , and many still do n't .
In recent years , though , a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6 % -- when an investor sells his shares .
Should n't they properly be called exit-load funds ?
The mutual-fund industry is debating the question , but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well .
And do n't expect anyone to change the term `` blue chip , '' either , even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , for one , is still a favorite of widows , orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side , it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture .
Also , blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years .
Larry Biehl , a money manager in San Mateo , Calif. , blames that on the advent of program trading , in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail .
Blue chips , he says , `` are now being referred to as poker chips . ''
Finally , even the time-honored strategy called `` value investing '' no longer means what it once did .
Before the takeover mania of the '80s , it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks , especially those with shrewd management , sound fundamentals and decent prospects .
Now , says Mr. Biehl , value investing often means `` looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble . ''
To institutional investors or brokers , he adds , a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up .

I was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries .
If the whole story were told , it would read something like this :
During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and `` Use of Proceeds '' confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made .
The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings -LRB- and management bonuses -RRB- ; the price , a sea of bad loans .
For the past several years , the banks , lacking a private navy to enforce their interests , have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits .
The Treasury wisely has refused , but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price : either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans -LRB- the Brady Plan -RRB- .
The banks will threaten not to make further loans , but in truth , lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy , they have no alternative but to go along .

Gillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , to its board , increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 .
Berkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $ 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake , and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board .
Separately , Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to $ 65.2 million , or 57 cents a share , from $ 63.9 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period ; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $ 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period .
Sales rose 9 % to $ 921.6 million from $ 845.7 million , with sales of the company 's operations `` well above '' the year earlier-period .
For the nine months , Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to $ 205.3 million , or $ 2.02 a share , from $ 207 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 period .
Sales rose 6 % to $ 2.77 billion from $ 2.61 billion .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the company closed yesterday at $ 45.50 a share , up 25 cents .
When Walter Yetnikoff , the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records , last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $ 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio , Mr. Guber jumped at the chance .
Within two days , he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony .
And before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business .
Not only that , Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company , Guber Peters Entertainment Co. , for $ 200 million , almost 40 % more than the market value of the company .
There was just one sticking point : The two had a prior commitment .
Just seven months earlier , they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit `` Batman . ''
But Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross , would empathize and let the producers go , knowing the Sony offer was `` the culmination of a life 's work . ''
He figured wrong .
Last week , following fruitless settlement talks , Warner , now merging with Time Inc. , filed a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters .
Sony promptly countersued , charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business .
The accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides : As one Sony executive puts it , `` It 's World War III . ''
That two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business .
And they are a very odd team in any case .
Mr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York .
He is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees .
Mr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand 's hairdresser .
Yet , they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood .
And despite their share of duds , they make movies that make money .
That is a skill Sony badly needs -- and Warner is loath to lose .
Although Columbia had a good summer with `` Ghostbusters II '' and `` When Harry Met Sally , '' rivals such as Warner , Paramount Pictures , Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office . After five years of management turmoil , with four different studio heads , Columbia sorely needs a stable , savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected .
Their stock in trade as `` executive producers '' is sniffing out hot properties , locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them .
Sometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` Flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` The Color Purple . ''
It falls to others to do the writing , directing and producing .
With 's `` Rainman , '' for instance , Messrs. Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production , but their names still appear in big letters on the credits , and they are inevitably associated with its success .
Sometimes , as with `` Batman , '' the pair really do make the film .
In that case , Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979 , nursed the movie through a dozen scripts , and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production .
`` They 're the best production talent around , '' says Brian De Palma , beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe 's novel `` Bonfire of the Vanities . ''
On that film , which is to start shooting in a few months , `` they 've been very much involved , hiring talent and discussing the development of the script .
And when you 're making a movie this big , you need all the help you can get , '' Mr. De Palma adds .
`` I wish they were around 24 hours a day . ''
And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention .
Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in `` Caddyshack II '' for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure .
`` We 've had a few bombs , '' admits Mr. Peters .
`` But by and large this company has only been profitable . ''
He says his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing `` is why we 'll be good at Columbia .
We practically ran our own studio . ''
Longtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two , a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing .
`` Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success , '' says Robert Bookman , an agent at Creative Artists Agency .
Mark Johnson , the producer of `` Rainman , '' chimes in : `` He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority . . . .
It 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material . ''
Mr. Peters , on the other hand , has fewer fans in Hollywood , and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully .
He gets better reviews as a creative whiz , an enthusiast , an idea man .
He also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did .
Barbra Streisand made him famous .
He cut her hair .
He lived with her .
He came to produce her records and her movies -- `` A Star Is Born '' and `` The Main Event . ''
Thrice married but now single , Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of `` Batman . ''
Mr. Guber , by contrast , has been married to one woman for more than 20 years .
But for all their intellectual and stylistic differences , they make the perfect `` good cop , bad cop '' team , Hollywood associates say .
`` Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal , '' says one agent .
`` If there 's a problem , Peter disappears , and all of a sudden Jon shows up . ''
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way .
Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , who shepherded `` Flashdance '' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie , bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film .
Says Mr. Simpson : `` The script was unreadable .
We reinvented it .
We are the producers of that movie .
They got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit '' as executive producers .
When Roger Birnbaum , an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s , left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio , they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop , including `` Rainman '' and `` Batman . ''
Mr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner .
`` I was upset with Roger , I fumpered and schmumpered , '' says Mr. Peters .
`` But he wanted to pursue his own dream , and he went . ''
Still , Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was `` one of the most successful I 've had in Hollywood . ''
The two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive , and Peter is very compulsive , '' adds Mr. Birnbaum , who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co .
`` Jon Peters will come barreling into a room , say he 's got a great idea , and be gone .
Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific . . . . ''
Mr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey , which became `` Gorillas in the Mist . ''
He says , `` Within a few weeks , we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey .
I think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas . ''
Universal Studios was working on a competing film , but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner .
More recently , Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers , reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner , for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes , the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest .
Messrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months , showing her a tape of `` Gorillas in the Mist '' to impress her with the quality of their work .
Money helped , too .
Ultimately , they paid more than $ 1 million for the rights .
The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers .
Some of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation , but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest . -RRB-
It 's hardly astonishing -LRB- given the men 's track record -RRB- that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters .
But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first .
Some note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract .
But though `` people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters , it 's good to have a partner , and obviously the chemistry works , '' says Steven Tisch , a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber .
`` This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day -- its about whether the ink is red or black .
In the case of Peter and Jon , the ink has been very , very black . ''
Mr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago .
Recruited from New York University 's MBA program , he rose within two years to head of production , overseeing such films as `` The Way We Were , '' `` Taxi Driver , '' `` Tommy '' and `` Shampoo . ''
In 1976 , he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks -- later called Polygram Pictures -- where they produced such hits as as `` The Deep , '' and `` Midnight Express . ''
In 1980 , Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters , by then a successful producer in his own right , after the death of Mr. Bogart .
While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others , their record was n't always so impressive .
Among their clinkers were `` The Legend of Billie Jean , '' `` VisionQuest , '' `` Clue '' and `` Clan of the Cave Bear . ''
And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates .
The studio says it stuck with them `` even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner . ''
Mr. Guber replies that `` this is a Goliath , this Time Warner , trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time . ''
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse , but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony .
`` From the beginning , -LCB- they -RCB- knew we had a goal and a dream , '' says Mr. Guber .
On a number of occasions , he adds , he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright .
`` They always listened , but they never acted , '' Mr. Guber says .
In 1987 , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment , a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman .
In July a year later , Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber , Peters and Sugarman made a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio , and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros . ' President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal .
But the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price .
Their relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter .
Last May , he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co .
Meanwhile , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract .
The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind , both financially and in terms of creative freedom .
But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month : the chance , at last , to run a major studio , about $ 50 million in deferred compensation , up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow , 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value , and annual salaries of $ 2.7 million for each .
The producers ' 28 % share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional $ 50 million .
Sony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner .
Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ 42 million last year .
And earnings have been erratic .
In the the latest quarter , thanks in part to `` Batman , '' Guber Peters earned $ 5.8 million , or 50 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 6.8 million , or 62 cents a share , in last year 's quarter .
Guber Peters stock , which traded as low as $ 6 a share last year , closed yesterday at $ 16.625 .
The two sides now are accusing each other of lying .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise .
But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court , Mr. Ross , Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made .
Warner , in its court filings , calls it `` a piece of fiction created for this litigation . ''
Mr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different .
For one thing , according to Mr. Daly , the producers requested a release in advance .
Moreover , the old contract was about to expire , and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now .
Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives , '' Mr. Daly said in his affidavit .
Warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia .
At the very least , Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony .
During settlement talks , for example , Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner , according to executives involved in the talks .
In any settlement , Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years , notably sequels to `` Batman . ''
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner .
And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts .
The last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief , they note , Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract , then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia .
In his affidavit filed yesterday , Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument : `` If Sony succeeds here , no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on .
THE SALES PITCH could n't sound better .
First , there 's the name : `` asset-backed securities . ''
Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing .
And there 's more .
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions .
Most earn high ratings from credit agencies .
Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues .
And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors .
Ready to jump ?
Well , think twice .
The concept may be simple : Take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors .
But the simplicity may be misleading .
Skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk .
They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate .
Moreover , the securities were introduced only about 4 years ago ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession .
`` A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters , '' says Owen Carney , director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency .
`` We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn . ''
Such concerns , however , have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products .
Since the spring of 1985 , financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .
They have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans .
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares .
Last year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders .
Some predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to Brazil , Argentina and other debt-ridden nations .
And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables , sometimes known as `` plastic bonds . ''
`` This is the heyday of debt , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , a newsletter .
`` Before the sun sets on the '80s , it seems nothing will be left unhocked . ''
The result is a $ 45 billion market , according to Securities Data Co .
That includes more than $ 9.5 billion issued through August of this year , up sharply from $ 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period -- and more than in all of 1987 .
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions .
But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in , and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market .
The entry fee is affordable : Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ 1,000 .
`` We expect additional offerings '' of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors , says Bill Addiss , a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
The process typically begins when an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust .
The trust then issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors .
Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings .
Enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions .
Asset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds , '' says Craig J. Goldberg , managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
But skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks .
Consider a $ 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables .
The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues .
On a $ 10,000 investment , that 's a difference of only $ 50 a year .
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street .
But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless .
`` If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an extra 25 basis points -LRB- 0.25 percentage point -RRB- becomes an important consideration on a career basis , '' says Mr. Grant .
`` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . ''
Moreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level .
That 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states , such as New York or California .
But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans .
He points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts .
Another concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash .
The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues .
That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature .
That 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans .
`` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice president of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm .
In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings .
There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem .
Investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities .
It is n't .
The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , Citibank N.A. , Citicorp or any affiliate thereof . ''
In other words , if there 's a problem , do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue .
The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency .
That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received .
That also is n't easy .
Take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company .
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
Nor does it cover the entire portfolio .
Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue .
Still , they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim .
But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper .
When you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties .
If a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports .
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions .
But despite the credit enhancements , despite the high ratings , some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets .
At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs , asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times .
At the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is , Treasurys .
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
But it could be much worse .
Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues .
For one thing , credit-card loans are unsecured .
In addition , they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession .
`` A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues , and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds , '' says Craig Corcoran of Futures Inc. , an investment advisory firm .
What about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues ?
`` Nope , we still say to stick with Treasurys , '' Mr. Corcoran replies .
Ratings , he notes , `` are subject to change . ''
All this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people .
And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. , of what he calls `` DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 :
`` More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations , scams and frauds of all time . ''

IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a one-word sentence : Diversify .
Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc. , serious investors have taken that advice to heart .
Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll , providing an in-depth look at their portfolios .
Those portfolios are remarkably diversified .
By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate .
For example , about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock -LRB- down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year -RRB- .
But only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market .
Similarly , 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund , and 33 % own municipal bonds .
But only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives .
The poll , conducted Aug. 7-28 , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics .
It found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood .
Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire , 951 replied .
The response rate , more than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence .
The results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors , though .
Journal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 .
Nearly half of the respondents -LRB- 47 % -RRB- said their investment portfolio was worth $ 250,000 or more , and 17 % said it was worth $ 1 million or more .
The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago .
For example , 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months .
Last year , only 8 % were expecting a recession .
An additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months .
Only 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth .
Apparently , the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much .
A slim majority -LRB- 51 % -RRB- think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989 .
Their verdict on real estate is almost the same .
Some 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months .
By contrast , only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold .
Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control .
Even though only 12 % actually predicted a recession , many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance .
Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession .
For the most part , the changes were `` slight . ''
The two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who `` do n't believe in trying to predict the markets '' -LRB- about 31 % -RRB- and investors who `` do n't expect a recession '' -LRB- about 15 % -RRB- or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' -LRB- about 22 % -RRB- .
A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents .
Most own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year .
Some 71 % had bought some stock in the past year ; only 57 % had sold any .
But the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark .
About 33 % considered another crash `` likely , '' while about 63 % said one is `` unlikely . ''
Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll .
And the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual .
About 60 % of them said they would `` ordinarily '' have at least 25 % of their money in stocks .
But as of August , only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size .
Most stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll .
But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious , rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon .

Moody 's Investors Service said it lowered its rating on about $ 75 million of this Chatsworth , Calif. , concern 's convertible subordinated debentures , due 2012 , to Caa from B2 .
It said the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives .
VALLEY National Corp. -- Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on about $ 400 million of this bank holding company 's senior debt to B2 from Ba3 .
Moody 's said it expects Valley National , of Phoenix , Ariz. , to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio , and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets , and from high loan-loss provisions .
Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage .
That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage .
`` Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies , '' said Noel D. Matchett , a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. , Silver Spring , Md .
It `` may well be '' that theft of business data is `` as serious a strategic threat to national security '' as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms , said Michelle Van Cleave , the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs .
The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry-government trade group .
Any secret can be pirated , the experts said , if it is transmitted over the air .
Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder .
They need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait .
`` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. Matchett said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught . ''
The only way to catch an electronic thief , he said , is to set him up with erroneous information .
Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year , most are n't yet taking precautions , the experts said .
By contrast , European firms will spend $ 150 million this year on electronic security , and are expected to spend $ 1 billion by 1992 .
Already many foreign firms , especially banks , have their own cryptographers , conference speakers reported .
Still , encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy .
One expert , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies .
Moreover , he said , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been `` erased '' from a computer 's memory .
He said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read .
No personal computer , not even the one on a chief executive 's desk , is safe , this speaker noted .
W. Mark Goode , president of Micronyx Inc. , a Richardson , Texas , firm that makes computer-security products , provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater openness , known commonly as glasnost .
Under Mr. Gorbachev , Mr. Goode said , the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications .
He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East .
Among the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company , which had n't been invited to submit a bid .
The Soviets ' eavesdropping paid off , however , because they got the contract .
The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp .
The University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 21.3 million -RRB- over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker .
It said $ 10 million would go to the University of Toronto .
Ciba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of C$ 866 million for Connaught , and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of C$ 942 million .
The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid , arguing that Connaught 's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught 's ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners .
The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid .
It said the new agreement would `` replace '' the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover .
`` Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught , this accord would enhance research and development in Canada , '' said James Keffer , the university 's vice president of research .
Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville , Calif .
In a statement , Jacques-Francois Martin , director general of Merieux , said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught .
While he did n't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university , he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies `` not currently producing and marketing vaccines -LCB- who -RCB- can only promise this for some... years in the future . ''
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday , Connaught closed at $ 28.625 , up $ 1.25 .

The Nasdaq Financial Index rose 5.04 , or 1.1 % , to 460.33 .
By comparison , the Dow Jones Industrials and the New York Stock Exchange Composite each rose 1.5 % .

Of the 4,346 issues that changed hands , 1,435 rose and 629 fell .
Jeremiah Mullins , head of OTC trading at Dean Witter Reynolds , said both institutional and retail investors were buying .
But there was a dearth of sellers , traders said , so buyers had to bid prices up to entice them .
`` There 's no pressure on OTC stocks at this point , '' said Mr. Mullins , who said some buyers are beginning to shop among smaller OTC issues .

one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison .
He also owes a lot of back taxes , interest and civil fraud penalties .
A lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think .
Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation , on the basis of occupation , high income , type of income , or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions .
Many professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters : dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off .
Mail-order ministers have been squelched .
Now , television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny .
The IRS recently won part of its long-running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return .
IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers , entertainment producers , masons , roofers , and taxi owners .
Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income , the IRS has said .
Once such abuses become so pervasive , the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them .
San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula , not because IRS agents envy their life styles .
Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices , have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them .
Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals .
And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers .
Unreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony -LRB- who gets a deduction -RRB- must report the former spouse 's Social Security number .
Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers , enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns .
But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these , the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention .
In most cases , the IRS says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses .
The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects , according to Marshall V. Washburn , deputy assistant commissioner for examination .
Auditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like .
The targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes .
Other projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips , people who engage in large cash transactions , and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year ; the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax .
And now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers , the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased .
Impetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back .
It prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. Washburn says .
The study provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business .
The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields .
For 1984 , they reported gross income of $ 1,647 from Amway sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 .
The Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins , who earned $ 65,619 in their regular jobs , treated the sideline as a real business and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from it .
The Direct Selling Association , a trade group , points out that its members , which include Amway Corp. , cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject .
The independent-contractor project , which began in 1988 , involves about 350 IRS agents .
In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 , reports Raymond P. Keenan , assistant commissioner for collection , they examined about 13,000 employers , assessed more than $ 67 million in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors .
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions , mostly paid by small firms .
Many workers , especially professionals , want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't .
But many others , who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation , become tipsters for the IRS , says Jerry Lackey , who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando .
Firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't , he says .
In his area , Mr. Lackey continues , the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction -- doing framing , drywall , masonry and similar work .
But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them -- including physicians and receptionists -- as independent contractors .
The IRS assessed the clinic $ 350,000 in back payroll taxes .
It assessed nearly $ 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands , cooks , bartenders , entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents .
Revenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 .
The state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with the IRS , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages .
Thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns .
The state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax .
Soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , says Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs .
The department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution .
In the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident .
`` We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project , '' Mr. Hicks declares .

In finding `` good news '' in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan -LRB- `` The Privileged Class , '' editorial , Sept. 20 -RRB- , you 're reading the headline but not the story .
The plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria .
But that does n't mean `` half of the students attending Berkeley '' will be admitted this way .
The plan is talking about applicants admitted , not students who enroll .
Since the `` yield '' from this top slice of applicants is relatively low , boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class .
In addition , perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials `` narrowly missed '' gaining them admission in the first category .
But against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria , the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades , test scores and `` supplemental points '' for factors such as high-school curriculum , English-language proficiency and an essay .
This category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants .
The plan thus will decrease by 22 % , for a net loss of 10 % , the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria .
Who will take over these places ?
The plan creates a new category of students from `` socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds , '' a concept not yet defined , and gives about 10 % of the class .
One of the plan 's authors has defended the `` socioeconomic disadvantage '' category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race .
Perhaps it does .
But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences .
Nor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action `` target '' for their group .
The plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program , based on `` socioeconomic disadvantage , '' on top of the existing program based on race .
The role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result .

FOR THOSE WHO DELIGHT in the misfortune of others , read on .
This is a story about suckers .
Most of us know a sucker .
Many of us are suckers .
But what we may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker .
What makes people blurt out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of ?
Do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand-prize winner ?
What makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door ?
Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off , once it is built ?
Because in the end , these people always wind up asking themselves the same question : `` How could I be so stupid ? ''
There are , unfortunately , plenty of answers to that question -- and scam artists know all of them .
`` These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick , '' says Kent Neal , chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , a major haven for boiler rooms .
`` Once they size them up , then they know what buttons to push .
John Blodgett agrees -- and he ought to know .
He used to be a boiler-room salesman , peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins .
`` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways , '' he says .
The most obvious pitch , of course , is the lure of big returns .
`` We 're all a little greedy .
Everyone is vulnerable , '' says Charles Harper , associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami .
`` These guys prey on human frailties . ''
While the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells , they often do n't , in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore .
`` The overnight success story is part of our culture , and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says Michael Cunningham , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville .
`` Other people are making it overnight , and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along . ''
Adds Spencer Barasch , branch chief for enforcement at the SEC in Fort Worth , Texas : `` Why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them ?
People are shooting for a dream . ''
Clearly , though , scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions ; the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy .
There 's also , for instance , the need to be part of the in-crowd .
So one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing .
Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while turning away numerous other eager investors .
The owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office .
Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged .
Such schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity . ''
At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham .
In appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others .
It also adds to the mystery of the venture .
Mr. Blodgett , the boiler-room veteran , believes that for many investors , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement .
`` Once people got into it , I was allowing them to live a dream , '' he says .
He phoned them with updates on the investment , such as `` funny things that happened at the well that week , '' he says .
`` You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives . ''
-LRB- Mr. Blodgett , who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive , is now on probation .
He says he has quit the business and is back in school , majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology . -RRB-
For some investors , it 's the appearances that leave them deceived .
`` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard .
Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment .
`` People honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' he says .
Paul Wenz , a Phoenix , Ariz. , attorney , says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery .
But Mr. Wenz , who says he lost $ 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and $ 39,000 in another , says a salesman `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the firm 's liability , and an insurance policy .
When he visited the company 's office , he says , it had `` all the trappings of legitimacy . ''
Still others are stung by a desire to do both well and good , says Douglas Watson , commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division .
Born-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches .
But hardly the only ones : The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children .
Psychologists say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud .
Scam artists seek out such people -- or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves .
For instance , salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking , `` Who wears the pants in your family ? ''
Or an investor who wants his accountant 's advice may be told , `` You seem like a guy who can make up his own mind . ''
Often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them .
William Lynes , a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. , says he and his wife , Lily , warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he , too , had once worked with Lockheed .
The Lyneses , of Powder Springs , Ga. , have filed suit in Georgia state court against Stuart James , alleging fraud .
They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding .
They say the broker took them out for lunch frequently .
He urged them to refer their friends , who also lost money .
-LRB- Donald Trinen , an attorney for the penny-brokerage firm , denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment . -RRB-
`` It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients , '' says Terree Bowers , chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles . `` We 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling .
Anything to make a sale . ''
Experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point , timing is crucial .
People may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives .
`` Sometimes when people are making big changes , retiring from their jobs , moving to a new area , they lose their bearings , '' says Maury Elvekrog , a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. , a Birmingham , Mich. , investment-counseling firm .
`` They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time . ''
They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money-retirees , for instance , trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses .
`` These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive .
Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way , '' says Jerald Jellison , a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .
Nick Cortese thinks that 's what happened to him .
Mr. Cortese , a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer , invested some $ 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns .
`` We were saving up to buy a house , and my wife was pregnant , '' says Mr. Cortese .
`` It was just before the Christmas holidays , and I figured we could use some extra cash . ''
The investment is worth about $ 130 today .
`` Maybe it was just a vulnerable time , '' says Mr. Cortese .
`` Maybe the next day or even an hour later , I would n't have done it . ''

Prices for seats on the New York Stock Exchange are recovering a bit after hitting a four-year low earlier this month .
Two seats on the Big Board were sold yesterday for $ 455,000 , and then $ 500,000 .
The previous sale was $ 436,000 on Oct. 17 ; the last time prices were that low was November 1985 , when a seat sold for $ 425,000 .
Prices peaked at $ 1,150,000 in September 1987 .
Seats are currently quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 asked .
FOX HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible , but at least it 's exercise .
At least it has a little dash .
Most of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither , drab duties rather than pleasures .
Like trying to buy life insurance , for instance , an endeavor notably lacking in dash .
Call it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible .
But sooner or later , most of us have to think about life insurance , just as we often have to think about having root-canal work .
And my time has come .
I 'm 33 , married , no children , and employed in writing stories like this one .
In times past , life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household , meaning men , but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it .
So if anything happened to me , I 'd want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts -LRB- though not , I admit , enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury -RRB- .
Figuring that maybe $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted , I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish .
Over the past decade or two , while I was thinking about fox hunting , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations .
Besides term life and whole life -LRB- the old standbys -RRB- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on .
What to do ?
First , generalize .
Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .
If all you want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits .
It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age .
But `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires .
It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it .
Even if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older .
So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks .
There are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others .
One variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders .
Upon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense .
Amex said it would charge me $ 576 a year for $ 100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years .
Sounds great -- or does it ?
First , if I canceled , I 'd have no more insurance , a not insignificant consideration .
Second , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit .
Third and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile .
That would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me .
Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else : There is no free lunch , there is only marketing .
And the Second Law , unique to insurance ?
If I die early , I win -- a hollow victory , since I ca n't enjoy it -- and if I live long , the insurer wins .
This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value .
The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead .
The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
That is gilding the lily .
The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into .
That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package .
Again , no free lunch .
This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect , your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection .
And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this .
So view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .
The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy .
You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years .
One newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life -LRB- you pay for the whole policy at once -RRB- , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment .
Congress closed this loophole last year , or thought it did .
However , Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield , Mass. , has developed a `` combination plan '' of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences .
But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small .
I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so I look into the broad category called universal life .
Hugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life .
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year ; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
In looking at these and other policies , I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into `` policy illustrations '' -- the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years .
They commonly give two scenarios : One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees -LRB- usually 4 % to 4.5 % -RRB- and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment , often 8.5 % or more .
Projecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ?
Not likely , I think .
Also , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year .
These are not certain , either .
Companies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm .
Another factor to consider : Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds , and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately .
There are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions about all of them .
At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . ''
I call her agent , David Dominici .
Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection .
If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection .
I do n't like the sound of that .
Some insurers have also started offering `` persistency bonuses , '' such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield , if the policy is maintained for 10 years .
But Glenn Daily , a New York-based financial consultant , warns that many of these bonuses are `` just fantasies , '' because most are n't guaranteed by the companies .
And the feature is so new , he adds , that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments .
So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection .
Offered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. , Jackson National Life Insurance Co. , and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. , these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive .
Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants .
But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
Also , financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes .
And considering the extra cost of such provisions , some figure that people interested in , say , paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it .
I 'm more favorably impressed by `` no-load life , '' even though it turns out to be low-load life .
Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot .
I compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such an insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen .
After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $ 792 , but Id get only $ 14 from the Equitable .
The difference is magnified by time , too .
At age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate .
Did I buy it ?
Well , not yet .
I 'm thinking about using the $ 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first .
A person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it .
Rorer Group Inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15 % from a year earlier , though the gain is wholly due to asset sales , Robert Cawthorn , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said .
His projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $ 17.4 million , or 55 cents a share , compared with $ 15.2 million , or 48 cents a share , a year ago .
Mr. Cawthorn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of `` somewhat less than 10 % . ''
Through the first six months of 1989 , sales had grown about 12 % from the year-earlier period .
Growth of 10 % would make sales for the latest quarter $ 269 million , compared with $ 244.6 million a year ago .
Mr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs .
Asilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London .
Thrombinar , a drug used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis .
He said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million .
As the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said .
Rorer in July had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989 .
He said the company is still looking for `` a strong fourth quarter in all areas -- sales , operating income and net income . ''
Mr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar , which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars ; to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase , and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer 's Maalox antacid , whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989 .
He said Rorer opted to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would `` kick start '' its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox , still its top-selling product with about $ 215 million in world-wide sales in 1988 .
`` We had underfunded Maalox for a year , '' he said , because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs .
He said Rorer will spend $ 15 million to $ 20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period .
A `` big chunk '' of that additional spending came in the third quarter , he said .
Hoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook .
The West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year .

New York Stock Exchange volume swelled to 198,120,000 shares .
The industrials were up about 60 points in the afternoon , but cautious investors took profits before the close .
Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally .
The consumer price index rose 0.2 % in September , while many economists were looking for a 0.4 % increase .
Stock-index arbitrage buy programs -- in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences -- helped the rally 's momentum .
The euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as American Express , while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as Caterpillar , analysts said .
Stock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in yesterday 's rally , traders said .
Institutional buyers were the main force pushing blue chips higher .
To the amazement of some traders , takeover stocks were climbing again .

But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye .
`` There is no strength behind this rally , '' asserted Chung Lew , head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America .
`` It 's traders squaring positions .
's not good ; the market is setting up for another fall . ''
Indeed , many traders said that uncertainty about today 's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks , prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices .
The number of outstanding contracts in the October Major Market Index jumped from 5,273 on Friday to 9,023 on Monday .
The MMI is a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Outstanding contracts are those that remain to be liquidated .
By Wednesday , the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524 , representing about $ 1.13 billion in stock , noted Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities , who expects a volatile expiration today .

The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment that President Bush sought to protect the U.S. flag from desecration .
The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution .
The vote , in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush 's position , was a victory for Democratic leaders , who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights .
`` We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution , '' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine .
In order to defuse pressure for an amendment , Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley -LRB- D. , Wash . -RRB- had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change .
Mr. Bush said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature , because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately .
In June , the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration , saying he was `` engaging in political expression '' that is protected by the First Amendment .
If you think you have stress-related problems on the job , there 's good news and bad news .
You 're probably right , and you are n't alone .
A new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from depression .
The study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies .
It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group , a non-profit organization with about 300 members .
The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' said Leon J. Warshaw , executive director of the business group .
In presenting the study late last week , Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial .
Occupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation .
In terms of days lost on the job , the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress , anxiety or depression .
He added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims .
`` We hope to sensitize employers '' to recognize the problems so they can do something about them , Dr. Warshaw said .
Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization , which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long .
Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance .
But although 56 % of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace , there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help .
The disorders , which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people , `` now strike people at the height of productivity , '' says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld , of the National Institute of Mental Health , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings .
The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem , with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing .
The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies .
More than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company .
Mid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings .
The study , which received funding from Upjohn Co. , which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses , also found 47 % of the managers said stress , anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production .
Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled .
Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses , `` stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout . ''
He also noted that various work environments , such as night work , have their own `` stressors . ''
`` We all like stress , but there 's a limit , '' says Paul D'Arcy , of Rohrer , Hibler & Replogle , a corporate psychology and management consulting firm .
The problem , says Mr. D'Arcy , a psychologist , is that `` it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance .
For Cheap Air Fares , Spend Christmas Aloft
IT ISN'T TRUE that a 90-year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on Christmas Day can fly free .
But his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in America .
In recent years , carriers have become much more picky about who can fly on the cheap .
But there still are a few ways today 's traveler can qualify under the airline 's many restrictions .
One of the best deals , though , may mean skipping Christmas dinner with the relatives .
This week , many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year , including Christmas .
In recent years , the airlines had waited until the last moment to court Christmas season vacationers with bargain fares .
That approach flopped : Last Christmas Day , a USAir Group Inc. DC-9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh .
So this year , the airlines are getting a jump on holiday discounts .
They are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70 % from normal levels for travel to most U.S. locations on Dec. 24 , 25 , 29 , 30 and 31 , and Jan. 4 , 5 and 6 .
The promotions -- dubbed everything from 'T- is the Season to be Jolly to Kringle fares -- put round-trip fares at $ 98 , $ 148 and $ 198 .
`` They 're trying to keep planes flying on days they 'd normally park them , '' says Roger Bard , president of Mr. Mitchell Travel Service in Burnsville , N.C .
Expect , of course , sky-high prices on other dates near the holidays when the airlines know vacationers are eager to travel .
Consider Adopting Your Spouse 's Name
IF CONTINENTAL Airlines has its way , couples like Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue may find it a hassle to qualify for some new discounts .
Continental , a Texas Air Corp. unit , recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to business-class and first-class passengers on international flights .
The Continental catch : Only immediate family members are allowed , and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof they 're related .
That irritates many women who have n't taken their husbands ' last name .
`` What a bunch of nonsense , '' says Jessica Crosby , president of the New York chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners .
`` This sets things way back . ''
Continental 's logic : It does n't want business companions abusing the promotion by falsely claiming to be related .
`` We accommodate their choice of names by allowing them to demonstrate '' family affiliation with legal documents , says Jim O'Donnell , a senior vice president .
But gay rights advocates are angry , too .
The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family .
`` It 's certainly discrimination , '' says attorney Evan Wolfson , whose group forced Trans World Airlines this year to change a rule that allowed travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members .
Take Your Vacation
In a Hurricane Area WHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast states , it downed electric and telephone lines , shot coconuts through cottage rooftops , shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives .
It also lowered some air fares .
Since the hurricane , Midway Airlines Inc. and American Airlines , a unit of AMR Corp. , trimmed their one-way fares to the Virgin Islands to $ 109 from prices that were at times double that before the storm .
The fares are code-named Hugo , Compassion and Virgin Islands Aid .
-LRB- Airlines are n't lowering fares to Northern California following this week 's earthquake , but reservation agents can waive advance-purchase restrictions on discount fares for emergency trips . -RRB-
Some hotels in the hurricane-stricken Caribbean promise money-back guarantees .
In Myrtle Beach , S.C. , the damaged Yachtsman Resort offers daily rates as low as $ 35 , or as much as 22 % below regular prices .
Says Michele Hoffman , a clerk in the resort 's front office : `` We do n't have the outdoor pool , the pool table , ping pong table , snack bar or VCR , but we still have the indoor pool and Jacuzzi . ''
Just Wait Until You 're a Bit Older
SENIOR CITIZENS have long received cheap air fares .
This year , the older someone is the bigger the discount .
A senior citizen between 62 and 70 saves 70 % off regular coach fare .
Travelers up to age 99 get a percentage discount matching their age .
And centenarians fly free in first class .
Next month , Northwest Airlines says , a 108-year-old Lansing , Mich. , woman is taking it up on the offer to fly with her 72-year-old son to Tampa , Fla .
Last year when Northwest first offered the promotion , only six centenarians flew free .
If All Else Fails . . . .
THE NATION'S carriers also provide discounts to Red Cross workers , retired military personnel and medical students .
There 's even a special fare for clergy that does n't require the usual stay over Saturday night .
That way , they can be home in time for work Sunday .
The British Petroleum Co. PLC said its BP Exploration unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the North Sea .
In an official release , BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day , and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990 .
As the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil .
For every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits ; it 's like a 50 % marginal tax .
But the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates .
Imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax .
Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage , largely due to the earnings limit , she would have to earn an additional $ 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $ 496 .
Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit .
Repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased Social Security benefit payments .
We now need support from the Democrats on the Rules Committee in order to include earnings-limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill .
Since all four Republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill , it is the Democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor .
The time is now to lift the burdensome Social Security earnings limit from the backs of our nation 's seniors .

When his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago , Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory .
Now his half-dozen employees work in an eighth-floor shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room .
He also says he is losing money now .
He blames imports .
But just down Seventh Avenue , where about 75 % of U.S. fur garments are made , Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets , broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather .
He credits imports .
The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years .
One stuck to old-line business traditions , while the other embraced the change .
`` The small , good fur salon is not what it used to be , '' says Mr. Purnick , 75 years old .
`` We make the finest product in the world , and the Americans are being kicked around . ''
Mr. Rosen , though , believes imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years .
`` You 've got some minds here that wo n't think progressively , '' he says .
Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing `` working-girl mink '' and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years .
Merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers : the younger woman -- even in her late 20s -- who never thought she could buy a mink .
The new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about $ 1.8 billion a year now , triple the level in the late 1970s .
It also opened the door to furs made in South Korea , China , Hong Kong and other countries .
Jindo Furs , a large South Korean maker , says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year .
Mr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made .
High-end U.S. furriers say these imports have n't squeezed them .
But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick , who once saturated the five-block Seventh Avenue fur district , say imports have cut their sales .
A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $ 2,000 .
Yet Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage .
Early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation .
In 1982 , he started a factory in Greece .
Two years later , he opened one in West Germany .
He also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur , and he decided to follow suit .
By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad , he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost .
To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources , he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S .
But six years ago he also began importing from the Far East .
Inspired by imports , Mr. Rosen now makes fur muffs , hats and flings .
This year he produced a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red , cherry red , violet , royal blue and forest green .
He has leather jackets from Turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars .
From Asia , he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs .
Next he will be testing pictured embroidery -LRB- called kalega -RRB- made in the Far East .
He plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets .
Besides adding to sales , leathers also attract retailers who may buy furs later , he adds .
Other furriers have also benefited from leathers .
Seymour Schreibman , the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. , treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment .
He says it accounts for 25 % of total sales .
Mr. Rosen is also pushing retail sales .
he bought two stores , one in Brooklyn and one in Queens .
Other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing .
Golden Feldman Furs Inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago , and now retail sales account for about 20 % of gross income .
In other moves , Mr. Rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers .
Since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest .
Small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his New York showroom have become fair game .
Such moves have helped Mr. Rosen weather the industry slump of recent years .
The industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 , but since 1986 sales have languished at their $ 1.8 billion peak .
Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc. , Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years .
Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons .
In addition , competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats , driving prices down .
The animal-rights movement has n't helped sales .
Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand , too , furriers complain .
And those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages .
`` The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs -LCB- in the U.S . -RCB- is not as available as it was , '' says Mr. Schreibman , who is starting overseas production .
But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing part of their allure .
`` People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , '' says Stephen Sanders , divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago .
`` You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury , '' insists Mr. Purnick , the New York furrier .
He contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs .
But Mr. Rosen responds : `` Whatever people want to buy , I 'll sell .
The name of the game is to move goods .
Four workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis , and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection , company and city officials said .
The four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities .
GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor , ARA Services Inc. , was suffering from a strain of the virus , officials said .
More than 700 people work in the GTE building .
The cafeteria remains closed .
Dr. Andrew McBride , city health director , said his staff suspects the hepatitis , which can be highly contagious , was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus .
The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week , Dr. McBride said .
Hepatitis A , considered the least dangerous strain of the virus , has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee , company and city officials said .
`` From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening , '' said Dr. Frank Provato , GTE 's medical director .
`` It 's a double-edged sword though , because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis . ''
GTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company , said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch .
The company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin , which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A , in anyone who has contracted the disease , Mr. Mattausch said .
`` We 're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot , '' Mr. Mattausch added , `` and that means virtually everyone who works here .
I was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial `` Colombia 's Brave Publisher . ''
It is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers , not the left wing .
This information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region .
Past Colombian government tolerance of the `` narcotraficantes '' was due to the drug lords ' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands .

I suggest that The Wall Street Journal -LRB- as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind -RRB- should put its money where its mouth is : Lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at El Espectador , buy ad space , publish stories under the bylines of El Espectador journalists .
Perhaps an arrangement could be worked out to `` sponsor '' El Espectador journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories .
Reward El Espectador 's courage with real support .

COCA-COLA Co . -LRB- Atlanta -RRB- -- Anton Amon and George Gourlay were elected vice presidents of this soft-drink company .
Mr. Amon , 46 years old , is the company 's director of quality assurance ; most recently , he served as vice president , operations , for Coca-Cola Enterprises .
Mr. Gourlay , 48 , is manager for corporate manufacturing operations ; he was assistant vice president at the company .
In the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy .
In a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign .
Two weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . ''
Mr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully .
A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued .
In an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary conditions . ''
In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy .
He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .
Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system .
Mr. Lawson 's speech , delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House , came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy .
Two weeks ago , in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % .
Despite the increase , the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .
It was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday .
Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed .
Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 , the lowest level since 1980 .
While lower joblessness is generally good news , the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped -- despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months .
Meanwhile , average earnings in Britain were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year .
Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record # 10.2 billion -LRB- $ 16.22 billion -RRB- last month , a much higher level than economists had predicted .
In a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner , Robin Leigh-Pemberton , Bank of England governor , conceded that `` demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated '' when the British economy was heating up last year .
He added that `` there 's no quick-fix solution '' to the economic woes , and said `` tight monetary policy is the right approach . ''
Discussing the recent slide in stock prices , the central bank governor stated that `` the markets now appear to have steadied '' after the `` nasty jolt '' of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago .
Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index , Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy . ''
Specifically , he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market , the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings .
Discussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when .
C. Olivetti & Co. , claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip , unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday .
The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor , which works several times faster than previously available chips .
Hewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year .
An Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December .
`` What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do , '' the spokesman said .
The new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product , '' said Patricia Meagher Davis , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
Executives at Olivetti , whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years , have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market .
Ms. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers , but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers , stockbrokers and medical doctors .
Although Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year , she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December .
`` We think the worst is over '' in the European information-technology market , she said .
Depending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals -LRB- a role usually filled by a minicomputer -RRB- , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer .
`` It 's the missing link '' in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers , the Olivetti spokesman said .
He added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line .
The machines will cost around $ 16,250 on average in Europe .
The Intel 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second , or MIPS , while Intel 's previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 MIPS .
Olivetti also plans to sell the CP486 computer in the U.S. starting next year through Olivetti USA and through its Ramo unit , which specializes in automating bank-branch networks .
Viatech Inc. said it received approval from the French government for its proposed $ 44.7 million acquisition of Ferembal S.A .
The approval satisfies the remaining conditions of the purchase , which is expected to close within two weeks .
erembal , the second-largest maker of food cans in France , had 1988 sales of $ 150 million .
Ferembal has 930 workers at four canning manufacturing plants and one plastic container facility .
Viatech makes flexible packaging films and machinery , and materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries .
Social Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation , boosting the average monthly benefit to $ 566 from $ 541 , the Department of Health and Human Services announced .
The higher payments will start with Social Security checks received on Jan. 3 , 1990 .
Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % , starting with checks received on Dec. 29 , 1988 , increasing the maximum SSI payment to $ 386 from $ 368 a month .
The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to $ 50,400 in 1990 from $ 48,000 this year .
As mandated by law , the tax rate will rise to 7.65 % in 1990 from 7.51 % and wo n't rise any further in the future .
This means that the maximum yearly Social Security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise $ 250.80 next year to $ 3,855.60 .
Beneficiaries aged 65 through 69 will be able to earn $ 9,360 without losing any Social Security benefits in 1990 , up from $ 8,880 this year .
The exempt amount for beneficiaries under 65 will rise to $ 6,840 from $ 6,480 .
The adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year .
Health-care companies should get healthier in the third quarter .
Medical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15 % on average for the third quarter , despite sales increases of less than 10 % , analysts say .
To offset sluggish sales growth , companies have been cutting staff , mostly through attrition , and slowing the growth in research and development spending .
Sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers , such as hospitals , to hold down prices .
Suppliers were also hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar , which makes sales abroad more difficult .
In some cases , competition has squeezed margins .
Becton , Dickinson & Co. , for example , faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market .
The Franklin Lakes , N.J. , company is expected to report sales growth of only 5 % to 6 % , but should still maintain earnings growth of 10 % , says Jerry E. Fuller , an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc .
Among the first of the group to post results , Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14 % to $ 196 million , or 88 cents a share , from $ 172 million , or 76 cents a share , a year earlier .
Sales for the company , based in Abbott Park , Ill. , rose 8.3 % to $ 1.31 billion from $ 1.21 billion .
Baxter International Inc. yesterday reported net climbed 20 % in the third period to $ 102 million , or 34 cents a share , from $ 85 million , or 28 cents a share , a year earlier .
Sales for the Deerfield , Ill. , company rose 5.8 % to $ 1.81 billion from $ 1.71 billion .
But not every company expects to report increased earnings .
C.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to $ 9.9 million , or 18 cents a share , from $ 20 million , or 35 cents a share , a year earlier .
Sales fell 1.2 % to $ 190.1 million from $ 192.5 million .
The Murray Hill , N.J. , company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market .
In 1988 , the company earned $ 1.38 a share .
The Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about the device 's design .
Some analysts add that third-party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bedevil companies ' bottom lines .
Takeover speculation , which has been buoying stocks of supply houses , may also ease , says Peter Sidoti , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
`` As that wanes , you 're going to see the stocks probably wane as well , '' he says .
Hospitals companies , meanwhile , are reporting improved earnings .
Bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals , National Medical Enterprises Inc. , Los Angeles , reported net income of $ 50 million , or 65 cents a share , for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 41 million , or 56 cents a share , a year earlier .
Humana Inc. , Louisville , Ky. , also reported favorable results , with net income of $ 66.7 million , or 66 cents , in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 58.2 million , or 59 cents , a year earlier .
Analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends .
Most important , hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline .
Moreover , companies have sold off many of their smaller , less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings .
Humana 's revenues , for example , are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company 's health maintenance organizations .
Says Todd Richter , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds : `` The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over .
Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said .
The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 % .
Counting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier .
These figures are n't seasonally adjusted .
A Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina .
The figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits , the official said .
Digital Equipment Corp. reported a 32 % decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter , causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected .
Although the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter , analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders .
The Maynard , Mass. , company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes .
Net for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $ 150.8 million , or $ 1.20 a share , from $ 223 million , or $ 1.71 a share , a year ago .
Revenue rose 6.4 % to $ 3.13 billion from $ 2.94 billion .
Digital said a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins .
A spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector .
The lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital 's line was a significant drag on sales .
Digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday .
The new line is aimed directly at International Business Machines Corp .
`` Until the new mainframe products kick in , there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end , and that 's hurt us , '' said Mark Steinkrauss , Digital 's director of investor relations .
He said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter .
DEC shares rose $ 1.375 to $ 89.75 apiece in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday .
But analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength .
Some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead .
`` I think the next few quarters will be difficult , '' said Steven Milunovich of First Boston .
`` Margins will remain under pressure , and when the new mainframe does ship , I 'm not sure it will be a big winner .
'' Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC 's current year from $ 8.20 a share to `` well below $ 8 , '' although he has n't settled on a final number .
One troubling aspect of DEC 's results , analysts said , was its performance in Europe .
DEC said its overseas business , which now accounts for more than half of sales , improved in the quarter .
It even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in `` double digits '' in foreign-currency terms .
That gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms , well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % , reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds .
`` That was a disappointment '' and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe , Mr. Stevens said .
Marc Schulman , with UBS Securities in New York , dropped his estimate of DEC 's full-year net to $ 6.80 a share from $ 8 .
Although overall revenues were stronger , Mr. Schulman said , DEC `` drew down its European backlog '' and had flat world-wide orders overall .
`` The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before , '' he said .
Mr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC 's new mainframe will `` occur somewhat more leisurely '' than many of his investment colleagues expect .
He said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December , with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June .
For reasons he would n't elaborate on , he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met , meaning less profit impact from the product for DEC in the next few quarters .

Colgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % , bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations .
Colgate said net income for the quarter rose to $ 76.7 million , or $ 1.06 a share , on sales that increased 6 % to $ 1.3 billion .
In the year-earlier period , Colgate posted net income of $ 60.2 million , or 88 cents a share .
Last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of $ 13.1 million , or 19 cents a share .
Reuben Mark , chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate , said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America , the Far East and Europe .
Results were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful increase in operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. business , '' he said .
Operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses , which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent , jumped more than 40 % , the company said .
Mr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities .
`` We 've done a lot to improve -LRB- U.S . -RRB- results and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. Mark said .
`` Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company . ''
Colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts .
The scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise .
The company 's domestic business , especially its household products division , has performed poorly for years .
Analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales .
For the nine months , net increased 14 % to $ 217.5 million , or $ 3.09 a share .
Sales rose 7 % to $ 3.8 billion .
The company earned $ 191.1 million , or $ 2.79 a share , in the year-earlier period .
Colgate 's 1988 net income included $ 40.1 million , or 59 cents a share , from discontinued operations .
Colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year .
Separately , Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. , a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica , Mass. , to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products .
The products -- sealants and bonding materials used by dentists -- all contain fluoride that is released over time .
The move is part of a drive to increase Colgate 's business with dentists , a company spokeswoman said .
Terms of the agreement were n't given .
USACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for $ 71 million in cash .
USACafes , which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas , said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible .
The Bonanza franchise system , which generates about $ 600 million in sales annually , represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets .
The sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court , USACafes said .
The company said it believes the suit is without merit .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $ 450 million in the next year .
AT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter .
AT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments .
AT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans , it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program .
AT&T said third-quarter net income grew , despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets .
Net income rose to $ 699 million , or 65 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 587 million or 55 cents a share .
Revenue edged up to $ 8.9 billion from $ 8.81 billion .
The latest period 's net was reduced $ 102 million , or nine cents a share , for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment .
The results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts , who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 % a year ago , because of continued cost-cutting efforts .
Sales of long-distance services , an extremely competitive market , rose 6.4 % .
But the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products .
Under the amended pension program , AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes .
Managers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 , whichever comes earlier .
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees .
Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package , which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months .
`` This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said Jack Grubman , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc .
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth .
`` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
Mr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future .
AT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses .
But the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire .
AT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie . Industriali Riunite , an Italian holding company .
For the nine months , AT&T said net income was $ 1.99 billion , or $ 1.85 a share , up 19 % from $ 1.67 billion , or $ 1.56 a share .
Revenue gained 3.1 % to $ 26.81 billion from $ 26 billion .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , AT&T shares closed at $ 43.375 , up 87.5 cents .
When it comes to buying and selling shares , Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one .
Every dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year , the firm estimates .
That makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
But wait a second .
Westridge Capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average .
Westridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing .
Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer , such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , and match its performance .
Institutional investors have poured $ 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns .
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers , much less beat it .
And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $ 100 of assets -- a fraction of the cost of active managers .
That 's because computers do most of the work , and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs .
But today , indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one .
Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average , they have developed `` enhanced '' indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points .
`` Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade , but the index money has been just sort of sitting there , '' says Seth M. Lynn , president of Axe Core Investors Inc. , an indexer based in Tarrytown , N.Y .
`` Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money . ''
Among the souped-up indexing strategies : Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks , or just a few dozen , rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies .
They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country .
With today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 .
Futures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market .
One reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the 500 .
`` There is n't a boatload -LCB- of big investors -RCB- out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says P. James Kartalia , vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. , Chicago , which offers both indexing and active management services .
After tripling in size in the past five years , index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds .
A further problem is razor-thin profits .
Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that .
To land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business , big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free .
`` It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account , '' says Axe Core 's Mr. Lynn .
As a result , indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money .
And many have been successful , as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital .
Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years , with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks , according to James Carder , the firm 's president .
Strategies vary for Westridge Capital , which has $ 300 million under management .
The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies .
Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines .
And in some months , he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all .
`` By their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover , '' Mr. Carder adds .
`` The more turnover , the better for our clients . ''
Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns .
J. Thomas Allen , president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures .
`` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says .
But some indexers make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for investors .
`` If the futures markets have a problem , then those products could have a problem , '' says John Zumbrunn , managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America 's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit .
Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus of a percentage point .
An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential .
There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds .
They include :
LIMITED RISK FUNDS : These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains .
Here a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $ 100 invested for a year , even if the market goes much lower .
The fund could invest $ 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed $ 95 .
That leaves $ 13 , which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index .
MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS : Say a big investor is interested in growth stocks .
Instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks , indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks ; the portfolio will be maintained by computer , reducing both fees and , in theory , risk -LRB- because of the large number of stocks -RRB- .
`` We see a lot of interest in those kind of things , '' says Frank Salerno , a vice president of Bankers Trust .
`` People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies . ''
TILT FUNDS : This is an index fund with a bet .
Instead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly , some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio .
One simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates ; this can avoid weak sisters , but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds .
Another approach : An investor with $ 100 million might use $ 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $ 25 million on a favorite group of stocks .
SPECIALIZED FUNDS : Indexes can be constructed to serve social goals , such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa .
Other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment .
Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System , for example , has about $ 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state .
Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month , this time 4.2 % , while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest .
The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September .
Amex short interest climbed 3 % to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares .
For the year-earlier month , the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares , indicating a 13.5 % year-to-year rise , while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares , a 48 % leap .
Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December , with increases in each month since then except at mid-July .
Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it , betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .
Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders .
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline , some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back .
Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging .
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock .
The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38 .
The ratio is the number of trading days , at the exchange 's average trading volume , that would be required to convert the total short interest position .
Some analysts suggest , however , that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions .
Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares .
Varity has proposed to acquire K-H Corp. , consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of Fruehauf Corp. , for $ 577.3 million of cash and securities .
Chemical Waste Management posted the biggest increase in short volume on the New York exchange , up 3,383,477 shares to 5,267,238 .
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , the entity formed from the recent acquisition of Squibb Corp. by Bristol-Myers Co. , logged the largest volume decline , 7,592,988 shares , to 12,017,724 .
Short interest in International Business Machines Corp. plunged to 1,425,035 shares from 2,387,226 shares a month earlier .
Also closely watched is Exxon Corp. , where short interest slid to 4,469,167 shares from 5,088,774 .
On a percentage basis , Germany Fund Inc. led the gainers , leaping to 67,972 shares from three shares .
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. led the percentage decliners , dropping to 59 shares from 183,467 .
The Amex short interest volume leader again was Texas Air Corp. , rising to 3,820,634 shares from 3,363,949 .
Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. posted the largest volume increase , 552,302 shares , to 2,157,656 .
The company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drugs .
Bolar has denied any wrongdoing .
The largest volume drop -- down 445,645 shares to 141,903 -- came in shares represented by B.A.T Industries PLC 's American depositary receipts .
The company is facing a takeover proposal from the financier Sir James Goldsmith .
First Iberian Fund led the percentage increases , rising to 73,100 shares from 184 .
Nelson Holdings International Ltd. dropped the most on a percentage basis , to 1,000 shares from 255,923 .
The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September .
Your Oct. 12 editorial `` Pitiful , Helpless Presidency ? '' correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 .
You are absolutely wrong , however , in opining that this position is some kind of `` flip-flop , '' something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls .
My position is one founded on both the facts and the law .
Although you may have forgotten , public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling -LRB- and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative -RRB- .
The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988 , and again on April 4 , 1988 .
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality , and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies .
Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him , and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing .
As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee , the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics , but made a decision in the summer of 1986 `` to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled . ''
As the report issued by the subcommittee concluded , `` Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war .

staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987 , administration officials say .
Administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the Panama crisis .
But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America , Everett Briggs , was gone .
He had just resigned , at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration 's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua 's Contra rebels .
The absence of Mr. Briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current NSC staff .
Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy , Robert Gates , are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs .
Gen. Scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control , and Mr. Gates has spent years studying Soviet politics and society .
Both have become confidants of President Bush .
But neither has an extensive background in Latin America , the Middle East or Asia .
In those areas , the role of NSC staffers under them therefore have become more important .
Gen. Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus .
But just as every previous NSC adviser has , Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained .

A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive , admitting his role in the Pentagon procurement scandal , pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for helping funnel $ 400,000 to a midlevel Navy acquisition official during the early 1980s .
Frank Lavelle , who at the time was the marketing director for Sperry in Clearwater , Fla. , admitted participating in a scheme to bribe Garland Tomlin , the Navy official .
Mr. Tomlin , who left the Navy in 1985 , pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy , bribery and tax-evasion charges .
The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985 , according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. Lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in Alexandria , Va .
Sperry merged with Burroughs Corp. to become Unisys Corp. in late 1986 .
Court documents filed by prosecutors indicate Mr. Tomlin tried to steer to Sperry a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment .
Mr. Tomlin , among other things , illegally provided Mr. Lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give Sperry an unfair advantage in the competition , the documents said .
Sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work .
Documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. Lavelle and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained `` approval of the scheme '' from more-senior Sperry officials `` because the payment which -LCB- Mr . -RCB- Tomlin requested was so large . ''
Charles Gardner , a former Unisys vice president , and James Neal , a former company consultant , have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes .
Unisys has said that all of the company officials who participated in improper activities have left the company .
Mr. Lavelle faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $ 500,000 fine .
The New York Stock Exchange said a seat was sold for $ 500,000 , unchanged from the sale Thursday .

Bureaucrats may deserve their bad reputation , after all .
Matthew Lesko , something of a professional defender of government , thought he had a sure-fire winner last summer when he offered $ 5,000 for the best `` verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you . ''
He sent out thousands of news releases from his Kensington , Md. , office .
He plugged the contest on Larry King 's radio show , on Pat Sajak 's television show and on the C-SPAN cable television network .
He talked about it in every speech he made as he roamed the country promoting his books , which dispense handy how-to advice on using government information for fun and profit .
Mr. Lesko figured he would be flooded with entries by now .
After all , he says , `` we 've got like 15 million bureaucrats . ''
And in addition to the $ 5,000 , he has promised the winner a `` My Favorite Bureaucrat '' plaque and offered each of two runners-up $ 500 .
So far , though , Mr. Lesko has received only one entry .
To make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat : A woman from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance who nominated her boss .
Mr. Lesko , who is making the rules as he goes , has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats .
But he says he would prefer to get nominations from rank-and-file folks .
He admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest .
Newspapers , including this one , have generally ignored his news releases .
Talk show hosts quickly change the topic .
But Mr. Lesko 's staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest .
`` Is the government not helping anybody ? '' asks Toni Murray , an assistant to Mr. Lesko .
Mr. Lesko himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation .
`` People hate to write , '' he says .
`` Maybe people do n't believe I want to give this money away . ''
Maybe Americans are just so annoyed with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while .
If he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something , Mr. Lesko admits , `` I 'd get 5,000 entries . ''
Now there 's an idea .
Ford Motor Co. and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after Ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return .
With the collapse of the talks Friday , European analysts expect Ford to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker Jaguar PLC , which is scrambling to fend off a hostile Ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with Ford 's archrival , General Motors Corp .
Saab , meanwhile , is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business .
Saab said last week it `` has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers . ''
Among the possible suitors is Italy 's Fiat S.p . A , analysts said last week .
Ford and Saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement Friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement `` that could make long-term business sense to both parties . ''
Individuals close to the Ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology .
Ford originally had seen a Saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the European and U.S. luxury car markets .
In addition , Ford and Saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations .
But the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far .
Some European analysts speculated that officials of Saab 's highly profitable Scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy .
Meanwhile , Ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make Saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market .
Saab 's problems were underscored Friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor -LRB- $ 186.1 million -RRB- loss during the first eight months of this year , slightly worse than Saab-Scania had forecast in its first-half report last month .
Overall , Saab-Scania 's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48.9 % to 1 billion Swedish kronor -LRB- $ 155.1 million -RRB- from 1.96 billion kronor -LRB- $ 303.9 million -RRB- a year earlier .
Industry analysts in Europe said the most likely suitor for Saab now is Fiat .
Saab and Fiat have worked together in the past , in one case developing jointly a new auto chassis that became the foundation of Saab 's 9000 model , Fiat 's Croma and Lancia 's Thema .
Last month , Saab-Scania Chief Executive Georg Karnsund said his company has had talks with Fiat about a broader alliance .
But the talks yielded `` nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it , '' he said .
As for Ford , analysts expect the end of the Saab play will allow the U.S. auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with GM for a stake in Jaguar .
The failure of the Saab talks `` makes it even more crucial for -LCB- Ford -RCB- to be victorious '' in the Jaguar contest , said Stephen Reitman , European auto industry analyst at UBS-Phillips & Drew in London .
Ford faces an uphill fight for Jaguar , however .
Jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with GM wrapped up by the end of the month .
GM , meanwhile , is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker 's headquarter operations in Detroit .
A GM spokesman said the visit is n't connected to the Jaguar situation .
But Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for , since the company 's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S .
Last week , Ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U.S. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the U.S. as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name .
So despite the GM-Jaguar romance , analysts say Ford by last Friday had boosted its Jaguar holding to about 11 % of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from 10.4 % early last week .
About 5.4 million Jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on London 's stock exchange Friday , and Jaguar shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence -LRB- $ 11 -RRB- .
On the U.S. over-the-counter market , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents to $ 11.125 .

The Dallas Cowboys are looking at a long-yardage situation , struggling to pull ahead of the Atlanta Falcons .
Up in his stadium box , their new and controversial owner , Jerral `` Jerry '' Jones , watches anxiously as the team bounds up to the scrimmage line .
Mr. Jones takes heart .
There in the center of the pack is quarterback Troy Aikman , the key to the Cowboys ' comeback strategy .
So key , in fact , that Mr. Jones signed him in April for $ 11.4 million over the next six years -- a record for a rookie .
`` He 's a genuine Wheaties-box athlete , '' gushes Mr. Jones .
With three minutes left on the clock , Mr. Aikman takes the snap , steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an Atlanta defensive back .
The crowd groans , Mr. Jones shakes his head , the Cowboys lose the game .
A few days after that Sept. 17 game , Mr. Aikman broke a finger , sidelining him for weeks .
Ah , the glamour of professional sports .
For Mr. Jones , losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the Dallas Cowboys -- and , this year , much of the National Football League .
Once fat and happy , the Cowboys now are losing games , fans and money .
Last year , the team ended up $ 2 million in the red on $ 30 million in revenue .
It has some of the highest costs in the league .
Its attendance is off 23 % from six years ago .
At the very least , Mr. Jones , who cultivates the society circuit as eagerly as his bench , can take comfort in one fact : These days , he is n't alone .
Nearly half the owners of the 28 National Football League teams are losing money , the result of flat attendance , aging stadiums and -- more than anything -- skyrocketing salaries for star players like Mr. Aikman .
Last year , the top 12 players on each NFL team took home an average $ 536,000 , a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball .
First-round draft picks have done even better : Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ 685,000 this year , up 44 % from 1987 .
`` It 's a vicious circle , '' says Art Modell , owner of the Cleveland Browns .
`` One team pays so much and the other pays more .
We just do n't have that kind of income stream . ''
All this is causing convulsions in professional football .
Owners , largely complacent in the past , are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue -- embracing some revolutionary ideas in the process .
Though not intentionally , the Cowboys ' Mr. Jones has come to represent this new breed of owner .
Shortly after buying 66 % of the team from H.R. `` Bum '' Bright for $ 145 million , and mindful of the Cowboys ' ragged bottom line , the 47-year-old Mr. Jones set about his own round of team cuts .
First , he unceremoniously sacked Tom Landry , the legendary coach who took the Cowboys to five Super Bowls and 20 consecutive winning seasons .
In Dallas , Mr. Landry has a standing just shy of sainthood .
Anti-Jones sentiment flooded the local press : `` A crude obnoxious hick , '' said one writer ; `` a real oink , '' said another ; `` Who in the hell does he think he is ? '' wrote a third .
For Mr. Jones , it was just the beginning .
He quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half , shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and , in July , announced plans to sell Valley Ranch , the team 's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL .
Mr. Jones calls the ranch `` the Pentagon of Sportdom . ''
It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms , elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer , more free-spending era .
He likes to tell the yarn of how he got lost on the expansive ranch during an early visit , took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help .
`` I said , ` Somebody come get me .
I 'm at extension 29 . ' ''
With a new day dawning on the sport , Mr. Jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury .
`` It 's just not cost efficient , '' he says .
The place costs nearly $ 2 million a year to maintain .
When he sells it , he says , the Cowboys will move to a more practical -- read affordable -- grass practice field near Texas Stadium .
And as for Tom Landry , well , in Mr. Jones 's mind , he had played out his winning years .
After posting losing seasons in each of the last three years , the Cowboys needed a change , he says .
Football has long been Mr. Jones 's passion , both on and off the field .
An Arkansas native , he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 University of Arkansas team that won a national championship .
After college , he worked at his father 's insurance company in Little Rock , and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the San Diego Chargers .
Years later , with cash from the sale of the insurance company , he founded Arkoma Production Corp. , an oil and gas exploration company based in Little Rock .
So it was n't surprising that Mr. Jones returned to his Arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for Mr. Landry .
He tapped Jimmy Johnson , a teammate on the 1964 University of Arkansas squad and the head coach at the University of Miami , where he led the Hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987 .
Whatever Mr. Johnson 's talents , in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans , he is no Tom Landry .
Seven games -LRB- and , after a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs yesterday , seven losses -RRB- into the season , the `` new '' Cowboys are n't doing any better than the old .
In fact , the last time they played this badly was in 1960 , their opening season .
Average attendance at their games , about 49,000 last year , continues flat .
Mr. Jones is attacking the problem on several fronts .
He continues to reshuffle the team , trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks .
To try to draw more fans , he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from $ 25 to $ 19 .
But the general trend , given rising costs in the league , has been to raise prices , and Mr. Jones is expected to eventually follow suit .
`` It 's simple , '' says Lamar Hunt , who owns the Kansas City Chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ 2.40 to an average $ 17 .
If we did n't increase prices , we 'd be in the red . ''
Mr. Jones has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping Texas Stadium -LRB- his deal with Bum Bright included operating rights for the stadium -RRB- .
The suites are air-conditioned , have wet bars and plush seating , and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $ 475,000 to $ 1 million , depending on their size and location .
Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players , and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time .
The sales job seems to be paying off : When he bought the team , only six of the suites had been sold .
Today , 30 have .
Gate receipts are only the Cowboys ' second largest source of cash .
The biggest is the NFL 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games .
Last year , the Cowboys ' share of that pie came to $ 17.6 million .
The team additionally earns between $ 2 million and $ 4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights .
Mr. Jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights .
He is also trying to get more stations in Mexico , where the Cowboys have a following , to pick up the games .
Mr. Jones , whose twangy voice and folksy ways belie an intense businessman who works 16-hour days , is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days .
He calls the contracts `` critical to winning in the NFL '' and has played his part in the bidding wars .
Besides signing Mr. Aikman to a sizable contract , Mr. Jones has agreed to pay rookie quarterback Steve Walsh $ 4.1 million over the next four years .
This wage inflation is bleeding the NFL dry , the owners contend .
Soon , only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams , predicts John J. Veatch Jr. , an investment banker with Salomon Brothers who handled the Cowboys sale .
To tackle the problem , NFL owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries .
Details of the plan , which would go into effect in 1993 , are sketchy , but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability .
Bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance .
The NFL Players Association , meanwhile , contends that athletes are paid a wage commensurate with their ability to draw fans , and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management , not players ' salaries .
The owners are trying to boost profit in other ways , too .
Many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are renegotiating dated stadium contracts .
Most of the owners must pay up to 10 % of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old .
In Chicago , for example , size is the issue .
`` We have the worst lease in the NFL , '' contends Michael B. McCaskey , the president of the Chicago Bears and a grandson of George Halas , who founded the NFL 's predecessor organization .
`` We 're in a metro area with millions of Bear fans , and only a small number can be accommodated . ''
When the lease expires in 1999 , he says , `` It 's got to be changed . ''
This year , the NFL also imposed an 80-player limit on teams going into training camp , down from 120 , in a move meant to trim payroll costs .
And the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract , which expires after this season .
The current contract pays the NFL $ 1.4 billion .
Owners say they expect the league to demand a 50 % increase , despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings .
An NFL spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable TV companies like ESPN .
The changes have n't come easy .
Like the game of professional football , the NFL organization itself is in turmoil .
The new breed of team owner , Mr. Jones included , has been fighting the NFL bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs , and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock .
In July , 11 NFL owners , almost all of them new , blocked an effort to install Jim Finks as a replacement for retiring league commissioner Pete Rozelle .
Mr. Finks is perceived by some owners as a standard-bearer for the Old Guard .
Earlier this month , another effort to choose a commissioner failed .
The owners meet again tomorrow .
For his part , Jerry Jones says he 's in the business for the long haul , and his work style seems to support that .
He puts in busy six-day weeks -LRB- excluding game days -RRB- , and on one recent afternoon fielded questions , in the course of an hour , from a TV producer , his luxury-suite marketing manager , a disgruntled customer and a roomful of Arkansas reporters .
To keep his schedule on track , he flies two personal secretaries in from Little Rock to augment his staff in Dallas .
`` When I made this investment , I made it on a lifetime basis , '' he explains .
`` I 'm not here to make money by reselling the team later on .
While the Cowboys may not be the best investment now , I do n't accept they ca n't be in the future . ''
Besides , to a large extent , Mr. Jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team , even though it keeps losing .
Owning the Cowboys has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in Arkansas just did n't provide .
There is the new private jet , the platoon of assistants , invitations to the best parties , and television appearances on shows such as `` Prime Time Live . ''
A few weeks ago , Mr. Jones even entertained Elizabeth Taylor in his private suite at Texas Stadium .
`` You 're in the catbird seat every day in this job , '' he says .
How interestingly clever of Robert Goldberg to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of `` Days of Rage '' in his television critique -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept 11 -RRB- .
He chastises Jo Franklin-Trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism , judging her project as `` intellectually slipshod . ''
Was not the title very clear ?
One example he gives : `` She did n't ask '' -LRB- why the Palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones -RRB- .
Really now , did she have to ask ?
Were not the pictures and happenings , which have been continuing news headlines , answers enough ?
Mr. Goldberg contends that even as `` propaganda '' the film fails because it presents only one view .
Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment ; of course the Israelis feel put upon .
But his complaint that `` Days of Rage '' does n't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant .
It 's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are .
This film did emphasize how long the stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done .
Well , `` Days of Rage '' airing with before-and-after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning .
Every issue is multisided .
This film attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media .
Now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only .

President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week .
Mr. Bush asked Congress to raise to $ 6 billion from $ 3 billion the amount of money Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift among the Pentagon 's individual programs , projects and activities , allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm-Rudman budget law was intended to inflict .
If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts .
That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has .
`` It 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said Chairman James Sasser -LRB- D. , Tenn . -RRB- of the Senate Budget Committee , who said he would oppose the request .
`` That is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose , '' he said .
The president 's request did n't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money .
A Pentagon official said the request was made to give the department `` maximum flexibility '' to deal with the cuts .
Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget .
That would give agencies `` less ability... to fudge over things , '' he told reporters .
Under the deficit-reduction law , 4.3 % of the Pentagon 's money and 5.3 % of other agencies ' money has been canceled .
Lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending deficit-cutting measure has been signed into law .
Rochester Telephone Corp. said it completed its purchase of Urban Telephone Corp. , of Clintonville , Wis. , the second-largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state .
Rochester Telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone , but a price was n't disclosed .
Urban is the company 's first telephone subsidiary in Wisconsin .
Since June , Rochester Telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three other Wisconsin firms .
A bill that would permit the Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms , which argue that the legislation is unnecessary .
The legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee .
Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies .
However , he recently told the Senate Banking Committee that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker-dealers , which are frequently used to issue bridge loans .
The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions .
Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk , high-yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans .
But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted .
In a July 6 letter to the Senate Securities Subcommittee , First Boston Corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate .
First Boston , whose holding company , CS First Boston Group , is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street , said it is also concerned that once the SEC has the power to monitor holding companies , it will try to regulate their activities .
`` The proposal , while well-intended , I think can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken , rather than strengthen the control the SEC has exercised for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker-dealers , '' Michael Raoul-Duval , managing director of First Boston , said in an interview .
The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. Raoul-Duval said .
Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say a compromise that would placate the industry while addressing the SEC 's concerns may be possible .
An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill . ''
Edward O'Brien , president of the Securities Industry Association , said that the securities-industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is `` hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the SEC 's goals . ''
Mr. O'Brien will elaborate on the SIA 's position in testimony before the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee this week , a spokesman said .
This letter was inspired by David Asman 's Sept. 25 editorial-page article about Fidel Castro , `` Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking . ''
I 've organized a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between Cuban and American artists .
In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity , consequently I 've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists , but also with Cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government .
Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort .
There is a simple reason for this : the Cuban people .
Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate .
Those `` people '' to whom I refer are not some heroic , indecipherable quantity ; they are artists , critics , taxi drivers , grandmothers , even some employees of the Ministry of Culture , all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution , spelled out in terms such as equality among all members of the society , reverence for education and creative expression , universal rights to health and livelihood , housing , etc .
In fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara 's famous linkages of art idealism and revolution seem modest .
It is on behalf of these people , and out of my real respect for them , that I am responding to Mr. Asman 's opinions of their country .
The Ochoa trial in July , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution , was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of Cuba .
However , unacceptable though those occurrences may have been , they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth .
Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel , the army and the Cuban people .
They are not interchangeable , since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances .
It is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the people -LRB- as we well know -RRB- , and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy .
Mr. Asman is also annoyed that Mr. Castro has resisted collaboration with U.S. officials , even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the Cuban regime , such as facilitating defections .
I think it 's a little disingenuous to be surprised that Fidel does n't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory .
We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom .
Without this basic level of attention to reality , our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years .
From my own point of view , given the qualities of humanity , creativity and warm spirit in which the Cuban people excel , we deny ourselves access to things we hold dear , and which seem to run in such short supply these days .
There is no rational justification for such behavior .

ENGRAPH INC. recently reported third-quarter earnings , which were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in last Tuesday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates .
Zacks Investment Research did n't adjust one analyst 's estimate for a stock split , which therefore was artificially high .
Engraph 's third-quarter net income of 15 cents a share actually was 7 % higher than the adjusted average of estimates .
Investors bailed out of New York City bonds in droves last week , driving prices lower and boosting yields .
One bond trader estimated that more than $ 50 million of New York City general obligation bonds were put up for sale Friday alone .
While that represents a small percentage of the city 's public debt outstanding , Friday 's selling followed a weeklong effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors .
`` I 've never seen so many -LCB- New York City -RCB- G.O. 's up for sale , '' said another trader .
`` Every broker has blocks of every size and maturity . ''
Municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health , rumors of a $ 900 million bond offering coming soon , and political uncertainty .
A spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue , but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks , before the November mayoral election .
General obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit . -RRB-
Although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled , many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold .
The fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that New York 's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected .
New York , one of the nation 's largest issuers of tax-exempt bonds , sold $ 750 million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago .
There have been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening , as the October 1987 stock market crash continues to make itself felt .
The recent sharp stock market decline exacerbated those concerns .
Meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding .
Rumors persisted last week that New York 's credit ratings -- single-A from Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-minus from Standard & Poor 's Corp. -- are at risk .
The weakness in New York City bonds follows a warning from New York state Comptroller Edward Regan that the 1987 crash seriously weakened the city 's economy .
In a study , the comptroller said , `` The city 's glory days are over . ''
Mr. Regan warned mayoral candidates `` to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city 's problems in the next few years , due to the now-evident weakening in the New York City economy . ''
New York City 's revised financial plan , due out later this month , is expected to include measures to balance the city 's $ 27 billion budget .
At present , analysts project a budget gap on the order of $ 500 million to $ 600 million for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990 , although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit .
Mark Page , New York 's deputy director of finance , said that investors ' concerns about the city 's financial health are `` unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves . ''
He charges the city 's critics with spreading `` unfounded emotional rhetoric . ''
There are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis .
The leading contender for the mayoral office , Democrat David Dinkins , has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs .
And the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election .
Until last week , Mr. Dinkins was considered a shoo-in .
`` The market can adjust to good news or bad news , but uncertainty drives people wild , '' said Bernard B. Beal , chief executive of M.R. Beal & Co. , a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market .
Until last week , `` Everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election .
Now , there have been a number of questions raised . ''
Last week , yields on long-term New York City general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point .
New York City 's 6 % bonds due 2018 , for example , were quoted late Friday at a price to yield 7.80 % , compared with 7.60 % Thursday .
As the yield on New York general obligation bonds rose , the Bond Buyer 20-bond general obligation index , the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market , held steady at 7.19 % in the week ended Oct. 19 .
Qintex Australia Ltd. encountered another setback Friday when its Los Angeles-based affiliate , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code .
Qintex Entertainment also said David Evans , its president and chief executive , and Roger Kimmel , a director , both resigned .
Neither could be reached for comment .
Earlier this month , Qintex Australia 's $ 1.5 billion agreement to acquire Communications Co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit the Australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction .
Mr. Evans had been the de facto head of for months .
Qintex Entertainment , a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries `` Lonesome Dove , '' said it filed for Chapter 11 protection after Qintex Australia failed to provide it with $ 5.9 million owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of `` The New Leave It to Beaver Show . ''
Qintex Entertainment is 43 % owned by Qintex Australia and said it relies on the Australian company for funding its working capital requirements .
After the announcement of the bankruptcy filing , Qintex Entertainment stock sank $ 2.625 in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 1.50 on heavy volume of more than 1.4 million shares .
The stock traded as high as $ 10 this past summer .
Jonathan Lloyd , executive vice president and chief financial officer of Qintex Entertainment , said Qintex Entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with MCA .
The $ 5.9 million payment was due Oct. 1 and the deadline for default was Oct. 19 .
Mr. Lloyd said if Qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ 92 million in debt under its loan agreements .
MCA on Friday said that as a result of Qintex 's failure to make the required payment it was terminating the distribution agreement on `` The New Leave It to Beaver '' as well as other MCA properties .
Qintex Australia was `` saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation .
They continued to represent that to the board , '' said Mr. Lloyd .
`` We were reassured they would stand behind the company . ''
Mr. Lloyd said both Qintex Entertainment and Qintex Australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ 5.9 million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on Oct. 14 .
At that point , he said , Qintex Australia stated it would `` endeavor to arrange '' the financing .
However a Qintex Australia spokesman said his firm had never `` promised or guaranteed '' to make the payment .
In a prepared statement from Australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the MGM talks , it `` had been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of Qintex Entertainment '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to Qintex Entertainment in excess of that previously made . ''
The Qintex Australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the Chapter 11 filing .
He said the company believed Qintex Entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means .
The report of the bankruptcy filing stunned Hollywood executives and investors .
`` It 's a shocker , '' said Joseph Di Lillo , chairman of Drake Capital Securities , a brokerage firm that has an investment in Qintex Entertainment .
Qintex Australia was `` going to pay more than $ 1 billion for and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ 5.9 million . ''
Qintex said Mr. Evans , the former president , resigned for `` personal reasons '' and that Mr. Kimmel , an attorney , resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying was no longer necessary .
Mr. Kimmel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since 1980 .
The announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between Qintex Australia and might be revived .
It 's understood that recently contacted Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. , which made two failed bids for the movie studio , to see if the company was still interested .
However , `` we are n't currently doing anything .
It is n't a current topic of conversation at the company , '' said Barry Diller , chairman and chief executive officer of the Fox Inc. unit of News Corp .
Financial printer Bowne & Co. said it formed a business translation service , which will provide legal , financial and other services in most major languages , including Japanese , Chinese and Russian .
Japan 's Finance Ministry strongly denied playing any role in the New York stock-price free fall .
Makoto Utsumi , vice minister for international affairs , said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to Japanese banks that they stay out of the UAL Corp. leveraged buy-out .
The ministry has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general , Mr. Utsumi said .
`` There are no facts -LCB- behind the assertions -RCB- that we sent any kind of signal , '' he declared in an interview .
The comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think Japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets .
A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another .
Mr. Utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about `` the status of their participation '' in one previous U.S. leveraged buy-out .
The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . ''
He said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation , and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry .
Mr. Utsumi also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out .
In general , Mr. Utsumi said , Japanese banks are becoming more `` independent '' in their approach to overseas deals .
`` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that -LCB- UAL -RCB- deal , '' he said .
`` They are becoming more independent .
It 's a sound phenomenon . ''
Sanwa Bank Ltd. is one Japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first UAL proposal .
A Sanwa Bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision .
`` We made our own decision , '' he said .
Still , Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks .
All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position .
Bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about Japanese banks getting in over their heads .
`` The -LCB- ministry -RCB- thinks the banks do n't know what they are doing , that they have very little idea how to cope with risk , '' said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified .
`` The -LCB- ministry -RCB- wants to see the Japanese banks pull in their horns '' on leveraged buy-outs , he added .
Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive , observers here say they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason .
Japanese banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , the analyst said .
Moreover , analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats .
Clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs .
At a news conference this week , Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly leveraged deals .
Despite Mr. Sumita 's statements , it is the Finance Ministry , not the central bank , that makes policy decisions .
While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever , Japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game .
Despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for Japanese banks to increase their presence in the U.S. market , bank analysts say .
Flush with cash at home , but with fewer customers to lend to , leading banks are eager to expand overseas .
Jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail-banking network .
France 's national tobacco company , known for making brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises and Gitanes , is branching out .
Concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products , it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes , but also into electronic car-parking payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores .
Brown tobacco in France is a more pungent , stronger grade than the lighter grade , or blonde tobacco , used in so-called American-style cigarettes .
`` We are n't Philip Morris Cos. , '' says Bertrand de Galle , chairman of government-owned Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A. , known as Seita .
He says that because Seita 's profits are limited by government-controlled cigarette prices , he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the U.S. concern has done .
-LRB- Last year , for example , Seita 's net profit soared 150 % to 461.6 million French francs -LRB- $ 73.5 million -RRB- on sales of FFr27.68 billion-a 1.7 % profit margin . -RRB-
Instead , he said in an interview , he is looking for ways to exploit France 's network of 39,000 tobacco agents , most of them cafes .
While Seita does n't own the French tabacs , its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities .
One proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in Paris .
Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines , which deliver little paper receipts , drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops .
Once activated , the card would sit in the car 's window , showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain .
When the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for later .
Seita is a partner in the project , which was developed by Matra SA using Japanese technology .
Seita and Matra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service .
And Seita is considering further diversification .
It wanted to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. 's French cracker subsidiary , Belin , in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores , but lost the bidding to food group BSN SA .
It currently is considering bidding for Swedish Match Co .
And it retains an interest in acquiring candies and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops .
It also is trying to shore up its tobacco business .
Brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises now make up just 40 % of the French tobacco market , half the level of about two decades ago .
While Seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in France , it is being hurt by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand .
So Seita has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label , and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful Gitanes Blondes in new packaging , similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco Gitanes .
The aim , says Mr. de Galle , is to win market share from imported cigarettes , and to persuade smokers who are switching to blonde cigarettes to keep buying French .
When the Supreme Court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions last July , the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving , trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds .
But the 5-4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities -- especially trespassing -- as on abortion rights .
The decision , Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services , illustrates how Supreme Court rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices .
In the Missouri case , unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state 's 1986 abortion law .
The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the Constitution .
Last year , a federal appeals court in St. Louis said the preamble was unconstitutional , citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states ca n't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins .
But the Supreme Court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services .
The high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws .
Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis .
The protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children .
Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . ''
Relying on the preamble 's statement that a fetus is an unborn child , the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives .
In another case , a protester , Ann O'Brien , was convicted of trespass before the Supreme Court 's Webster ruling .
Last week , when her appeal was argued before the Missouri Court of Appeals , her lawyer also relied on the preamble .
`` The effect of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs. Wade , and I think this is one of the cracks , '' said Mark Belz , a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters .
Roe vs. Wade was the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion .
Mario Mandina , president of Kansas City Lawyers for Life , says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , `` This will shut down abortion in Missouri .
There 's no risk to the protesters , and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are 3,000 people standing outside every day . ''
That would be an ironic result of a case in which the Supreme Court expressly stopped short of overruling Roe vs. Wade .
In two other cases , the possible consequences of the Supreme Court ruling appear even more unintended .
In one , the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of Columbia , Mo. , who was charged with drunk driving , argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception , not from birth .
In Missouri , those caught drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may have their licenses revoked for one year , while those 21 or older suffer only a 30-day suspension .
A Boone County judge rejected the motion , but Daniel Dodson , a Jefferson City lawyer , says he has appealed .
And in a case filed in federal court in August , a lawyer is arguing that Missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery .
In terms of sheer brutality , the Somali regime of Siad Barre may rank as No. 1 in the world .
The only reason that Somalia remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of Texas .
The Barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill .
Beheading small children , stabbing elderly people to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the Somali armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years .
Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of the behavior of President Barre 's troops .
In the port of Berbera , for example , hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan were rounded up in May 1988 , imprisoned , and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever .
Guns were never used : Each man was stabbed to death with a large knife .
The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees .
The study was done by Robert Gersony , a consultant to the U.S. State Department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide .
What gives these events particular significance , however , is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa .
Not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks .
Mr. Barre 's rule is crumbling fast .
Mutinies wrack his armed forces -LRB- really just an armed gang -RRB- , which control less than half the country .
Inflation is at record levels .
Desperate , he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of Mogadishu .
Seventy years old and a self-declared `` scientific socialist , '' President Barre has a power base , composed only of his minority Mareham clan , that according to observers is `` narrowing . ''
The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean .
That strip of concrete is backed up by a few one-story , air-conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals -- buttressed by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated -- maintain radio contact with the outside world .
In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control .
As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia , the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets ' array of airfields next door .
But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway .
On Sept. 7 , I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas .
Recently , in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia , Tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops .
-LRB- Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in Lebanon , a small country of little strategic importance -RRB-
Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa , threatening the town of Dese , which would cut off Mr. Mengistu 's capital from the port of Assab , through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis Ababa .
As a result , Mr. Mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from Eritrea just to hold the town , thereby risking the loss of even more territory in Eritrea only to keep the Tigreans at bay .
Mr. Mengistu is in an increasingly weak position : Half his army is tied down defending the northern city of Asmara from the Eritreans .
The weaker he gets , the more he turns toward the U.S. for help .
While the Tigreans are communists , like the Eritreans they are among the most anti-Soviet guerrillas in the world , having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the Soviet-supplied Mengistu air force .
What this all means in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre 's regime in Somalia is .
The U.S. , therefore , has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa .
Back to Somalia : The State Department , to its credit , has already begun distancing itself from Mr. Barre , evinced by its decision to publish the Gersony report -LRB- which the press has ignored -RRB-
What 's more , the U.S. has suspended $ 2.5 million in military aid and $ 1 million in economic aid .
But this is not enough .
Because the U.S. is still perceived to be tied to Mr. Barre , when he goes the runway could go too .
Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis to understand .
It is a certainty that Mr. Barre 's days are numbered .
The U.S. should take care , however , that its own position in the country does not go down with him .
Nobody is sure what will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be .
But as one expert tells me : `` Whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than Barre . ''
While the State Department positions itself for the post-Barre period in Somalia , it should continue to back former President Carter 's well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia , while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan .
Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and Byzantine in all of black Africa .
Remember that it took Mr. Mengistu many months , in what became known as the `` creeping coup , '' to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975 .
There is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly , as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent .
But the U.S. has one great advantage : The Soviets are universally loathed throughout Ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all .
It 's not just in Eastern Europe where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side , but on the horn of Africa as well .
The only U.S. liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. Barre , and that should be cut fast .

OPEC 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets .
Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out .
But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if OPEC does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters .
As a result , the effort by some oil ministers to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency .
The organization is scheduled to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25 .
So far this year , rising demand for OPEC oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others .
But that could change if demand for OPEC 's oil softens seasonally early next year as some think may happen .
OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day , sharply above its nominal , self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million , according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune .
At that rate , a majority of OPEC 's 13 members have reached their output limits , they said .
But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within OPEC .
Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries , including his own , Issam Al-Chalabi , Iraq 's oil minister , told the conference Friday .
He puts OPEC 's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels a day .
That 's higher than some other estimates .
Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah , Kuwait 's oil minister , recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day .
Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge .
Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq , could upset the market .
The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market .
However , in interviews later , both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member .
Under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC 's production ceiling than they would under the current system .
`` If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % of your capacity , what 's the good to be told you can produce at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked Mr. Al-Chalabi .
At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month , OPEC 's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling .
They doled it out using the existing formula , however , which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official allotments .
The main effect of the ceiling boost was to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters .
Still , there was a breakthrough at Geneva .
Previously , no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target , or ceiling .
But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced there in an Iranian proposal , was generally endorsed by the ministers .
In the end politics got in the way .
Libya accepted Iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with Kuwait .
And the United Arab Emirates , a chronic quota cheater , refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways .
But the oil ministers continue to study the plan , and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting .
It 's understood several compromises already have been worked into the plan .
The ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others .
Libya 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem , although the United Arab Emirates is still an issue .
Saudi Arabia , OPEC 's kingpin , also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some OPEC sources said .
Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members .
In Geneva , however , they supported Iran 's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million .
Some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on Saudi Arabia to `` give back '' to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels .
Though tiny , that 's a reduction in its share .
Mr. Nazer , the Saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions .
`` Under any circumstances , Saudi Arabia should get more '' rather than less , Mr. Nazer said .
In a blow to France 's Rafale jet fighter , the French navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy 15 McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-18 Hornets to defend its aircraft carriers .
The statement is likely to sharpen the debate within France 's military establishment over the Rafale , which is made by Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA .
In an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine Cols Bleus , the navy 's second-in-command , Adm. Yves Goupil , said the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century .
The air force is to take at least 250 more .
Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack .
Rather than renovate the Crusaders , which Dassault is proposing to do for around 1.8 billion French francs -LRB- $ 286.6 million -RRB- , Adm. Goupil said the navy wants to buy used F-18s from the U.S. Navy .
Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale .
Adm. Goupil said that when the F-18s wear out , the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them .
But unofficially , senior navy officials sharply criticize the Rafale as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use .
Although they never said so publicly , they have made no secret of their preference for the F-18 on operational grounds .
Adm. Goupil 's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of Dassault .
Although government-controlled , Dassault still is run by the founder 's son , Chairman Serge Dassault , who has fiercely protected his company 's independence .
The Rafale project is the result of France 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs .
So far , Mr. Dassault has resisted pressure to change .
What brought the naval issue to a head is that the Crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to replace them .
Adm. Goupil , a former Crusader squadron leader , said that the last other country to use Crusaders , the Philippines , retired its last ones two years ago .
A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here .
Adm. Goupil rejected Dassault 's proposal to renovate the Crusaders , saying the cost was impossible to estimate .
Even modernized , he said , the Crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers France has sent to meet such crises as the wars in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf .
Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement told a meeting of the Anglo-American Press Association that the question of modernizing the Crusaders or buying used F18s is a `` political '' decision that he will make in due time .

Spending by Japanese households averaged 290,782 yen -LRB- $ 2,052.10 -RRB- in August .
In nominal terms it rose 0.6 % from a year earlier before adjustment .
August adjusted spending by wage-earning families was down 0.6 % to 309,381 yen from a year earlier .
The real income of wage-earning families in the month eased 1.2 % to 438,845 yen from the previous year .
For Cathay Pacific Airways , the smooth ride may be ending .
The first signs of trouble came last month when the Hong Kong carrier , a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd. , posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year .
Securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing Cathay 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead .
Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through Hong Kong remains clouded by China 's turmoil since the June 4 killings in Beijing .
In addition , delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 Boeing 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes .
And tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline .
There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China 's sovereignty in 1997 , Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China 's often-disparaged flag carrier , Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC .
`` The sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before , '' says Rod Eddington , Cathay 's commercial director .
Sarah Hall , an analyst at James Capel -LRB- Far East -RRB- Ltd. , says there is n't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , Hong Kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar .
These factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one , Ms. Hall says .
Ms. Hall expects Cathay 's profit to grow around 13 % annually this year and next .
In 1988 , it earned $ 2.82 billion Hong Kong -LRB- US$ 361.5 million -RRB- on revenue of HK$ 11.79 billion .
Cathay is taking several steps to bolster business .
One step is to beef up its fleet .
In addition to aircraft from Boeing Co. , Cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 Airbus A330-300s .
The expansion , which could cost as much as US$ 5.7 billion over the next eight years , will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991 , up from 30 at the end of last year , according to Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd .
The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay 's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights , while the Boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to Europe and North America .
Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong .
Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain .
Some jobs already have been moved to Australia , and there are plans to place others in Canada .
David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 .
Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover .
Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights , Cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors .
Mr. Eddington regards promoting Hong Kong as an important part of attracting visitors from Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged .
There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal .
Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation .
Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay 's strategy .
But he emphasizes that Cathay has n't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa , the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade .
Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .
`` We think alliances are very important , '' Mr. Eddington says .
`` But we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's .
I 'm not sure cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother . ''
In a pattern it aims to copy in several key U.S. destinations , Cathay recently announced plans to serve San Francisco by flying into American Airlines ' Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U.S. carrier .
`` We 'll never have a big operation in the U.S. , and they 'll never have one as big as us in the Pacific , '' Mr. Eddington says .
`` But this way , American will coordinate good extensions to Boston , New York , Chicago and Dallas .
We 'll coordinate on this end to places like Bangkok , Singapore and Manila . ''
Asian traffic , which currently accounts for 65 % of Cathay 's business , is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay .
Cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into China to 14 , and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into Vietnam .
Further expansion into southern Europe is also possible , says Mr. Bell , the spokesman .
While a large number of Hong Kong companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997 , such a move is n't an option for Cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in Hong Kong .
And Mr. Eddington emphatically rules out a move to London : `` Our lifeblood is Hong Kong traffic rights . ''
He says the airline is putting its faith in the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong 's return to China .
A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for Hong Kong 's airlines , which include the smaller Hong Kong Dragon Airlines , will continue to be negotiated by Hong Kong 's government .
But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing .
`` My feeling is -LCB- Cathay does n't -RCB- have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified .
Cathay would love to keep going , but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something . ''
Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future .
`` We 're confident that it protects our route structure , '' he says , `` and our ability to grow and prosper .
Falcon Cable Systems Co. said it proposed an amendment that would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65 % of the company 's fair market value from the 40 % currently allowed .
Falcon , a limited partnership , said it wanted the increase in order to continue its $ 2.15-per-unit annual payment , and for expansion and acquisitions .
A spokesman for the company said a meeting would be held for shareholders to vote on the amendment before year 's end .

In the hard-hit Marina neighborhood , life after the earthquake is often all too real , but sometimes surreal .
Some scenes : -- Saturday morning , a resident was given 15 minutes to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could of her life 's possessions
Saturday night she dined in an emergency shelter on salmon steaks prepared by chefs from one of the city 's four-star restaurants .
-- Mayor Art Agnos stands in the glare of television lights trying to explain for the 20th time why the city is severely restricting access to badly damaged structures .
A couple in fashionable spandex warm-up suits jogs by , headphones jauntily in place , weaving their way along a street of fractured and fallen houses .
At a nearby corner , they swerve perilously close to a listing apartment house , oblivious to any danger .
A policeman shakes his head in amazement as he steers them away .
-- A young woman who has been out of town shows up at the Marina Middle School to learn that her apartment is on the condemned list .
She is told she ca n't enter unless she is accompanied by an inspector .
She bursts into tears and walks away .
Nearby , five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on stools , having their necks and backs kneaded by volunteer masseuses .
The Marina rescue center offered a very San Franciscan response to the disaster .
In addition to free massages , there was free counseling , phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club , which offered up its showers , saunas and hot tubs .
The cafeteria offered donated croissants and brie for breakfast , and for dinner , pasta salad and chocolate mousse torts along with the salmon .
`` This has been a 15-pound earthquake for me , '' said resident Joan O'Shea , who works in an acupuncturist 's office .
She and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free yoga classes and `` aroma therapy '' -- massages with scented oils .
She finds the response of Marina residents -- primarily yuppies and elderly people -- to the devastation of their homes `` incredible .
People have been very respectful of each other .
I do n't know if this would have happened somewhere else . ''
Out on the streets , some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a 15-minute scavenger hunt through their possessions .
`` It 's so weird to have to decide what 's really important to you , '' said Barbara May .
She went first for personal mementos .
In post-earthquake parlance , her building is a `` red . ''
After being inspected , buildings with substantial damage were color-coded .
Green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes .
Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness .
Some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases , others threw goods out windows .
It did n't help that on Saturday , after three days of sunshine , it rained .
`` The guys are going for their skis , their stereos , their personal computers , '' said Frank Fitzgerald , who helped others empty their apartments .
`` The women wanted photo albums , a certain brooch , kind of sentimental things . ''
He showed an unbroken , still-ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for one woman .
It belonged to her grandfather .
Some residents defied orders and returned to `` red '' buildings to retrieve goods .
One building was upgraded to red status while people were taking things out , and a resident who was n't allowed to go back inside called up the stairs to his girlfriend , telling her to keep sending things down to the lobby .
A policewoman had to be called in to make her leave ; the policewoman helped carry out one last load .
Enforcement of restricted-entry rules was sporadic , residents said .
One man trying to remove his car was told by officials to get out of his garage .
When he sneaked back later to try again , a different policeman offered to help him get the car out .
The Marina also has become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake .
On lampposts along Fillmore Street , a major Marina artery , posters were offering a $ 100 reward for a cat lost during the quake .
The San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also has been providing medical care , food , water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals .
The SPCA says it has received more than 100 requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats , though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish .
For example , one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment , like many others in the Marina , did n't have heat .
`` She can stay there with no heat , but for a parakeet , that can be deadly , '' says Daralee Konowitch , animalcare services manager for the SPCA .
A warm foster home has been found .
The neighborhood around Alexander Haagen Co. 's Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles resembles the crime-ridden , deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit .
But turn into the shopping center 's parking lot , and one could be in the safe , busy mall of a prosperous suburb .
Only it is safer , and busier .
Over the past year there have been only one burglary , three thefts of or from autos , no purse-snatchings , and one attempted robbery in the mall , which opened in late 1981 .
A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would , per year , be expected to have eight burglaries , 70 thefts of or from autos , and four robberies .
The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 .
Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well .
A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability .
Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices .
Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents .
Thus there is even more to the Vermont-Slauson Center than a good place to shop .
This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible .
The center improves the community image to outsiders as well , and may help to arrest , or even reverse , the exodus of capital and investment .
An additional benefit is the creation of jobs .
This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers .
It continues through the life of the center ; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ 2,500 per job .
As many of these jobs are filled by local residents , who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls , the $ 2,500-per-job public investment should repay itself in a few years .
And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like .
Profits are also plowed back into the community ; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60 % of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community -- now running into the hundreds of units -- as well as commercial and industrial development projects .
Bradford Crowe , director of the mayor 's City Economic Development Office , says : `` There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood .
What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock , thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields . ''
Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women .
In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago 's Third Ward , opposite the Robert Taylor Homes , 29 % of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14 % to members of other minority groups .
Children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins .
So what 's the catch ?
Primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time , patience , breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess .
Security costs are also quite high .
One of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies , local political leaders , and citizen groups , and with prospective tenants and sources of financing .
Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications -- inner-city deals just have more of them .
Security at a typical Haagen inner-city center is impressive , but unobtrusive .
The entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates .
Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance .
Infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center ; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard .
The security command post , camouflaged as second-story retail space , has its own `` crow 's nest '' above the roofs of the other buildings , with a panoramic view of the entire center .
Local law enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated by the center .
These features are also used in Matanky Realty Group 's Grand Boulevard Plaza .
Haagen has its own large security force of well-trained and well-paid personnel on round-the-clock duty at each center .
Security is 60 % to 70 % of the common area charges of these centers , vs. an industry average of about 15 % .
These security costs are kept off-budget because the centers ' site acquisition , construction , and financing costs were reduced by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants , Economic Development Administration Grants , Community Development Block Grants , tax-free Industrial Development Bonds , Enterprise Zone tax write-offs , city infrastructure grants , and tax increment financing .
Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back .
However , since these centers appear to pay for themselves , there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions .
Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities .
These programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning , identifying sources of funds , and for acquiring a site and preparing it .
Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date .
With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers , inner-city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment .
New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets .
If the risks and rewards are reasonable , developers will respond .
Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves .
The answer will be obvious .

Dow , of Midland , Mich. , said its unit will begin by Thursday a tender offer of $ 12.25 a share for all PSE common shares outstanding .
Among other conditions , the offer depends on the Dow unit acquiring at least 66 % of the PSE shares outstanding , the companies said in a joint statement Friday .
PSE has about 9.2 million shares outstanding .
The company said the approximately $ 115 million acquisition price includes its total $ 33 million of long-term debt outstanding .
Dow said it already has agreements with Albert J. Smith Jr. , chairman and chief executive officer of PSE , and certain other officers of the company under which Dow may buy about 40 % of the PSE common shares outstanding .

If growth regains its glamour among investors , a sluggish segment of the Nasdaq over-the-counter market could show some flash .
Some stock pickers already are targeting the OTC market , where , they say , await plenty of small - and medium-sized growth stocks .
Best of all , they add , these growth issues , unlike their big blue-chip cousins on the New York Stock Exchange , are languishing at depressed prices .
Growth stocks will return to favor , some analysts and money managers think , because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on Oct. 13 , and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements .
Against such a backdrop , companies with proven track records of earnings gains of 20 % or so annually have extra appeal .
`` The market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , '' declares Mary Farrell , a PaineWebber analyst .
Among her OTC picks are Oshkosh B'Gosh and A&W Brands .
Like many OTC growth issues , they have market values -- as measured by stock price times shares outstanding -- of roughly $ 100 million to $ 500 million .
Some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long .
These are sometimes dubbed `` emerging '' growth companies , though they also have expanding-profit track records .
While many growth stocks are small , not all small stocks have earnings-growth momentum .
That 's an important distinction because some analysts and brokers , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks .
`` You can find some good , quality companies over the counter , '' but investors should be selective , says John Palicka , chief portfolio manager at Midco Investors , a Newark , N.J. , money management company with about $ 900 million invested in growth stocks of varying sizes .
Mr. Palicka 's picks from the OTC market include Legent , Mail Boxes Etc. , and Payco American .
The main argument for growth stocks is their usually superior performance in a slowing economy .
`` If the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth stocks , '' says L. Keith Mullins , a growth-stock analyst at Morgan Stanley .
Eventually , he believes , investors will be willing to pay higher prices for companies with proven track records of earnings growth .
In anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now .
Understandably , smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently .
The average issue on Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index gained 35 % last year , Ms. Farrell of PaineWebber says .
Smaller-stock earnings , by comparison , rose between 15 % and 20 % .
In addition , earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year .
Also , the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded , and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips .
As a result , Morgan Stanley 's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24 % and the S&P 500 has grown 25 % .
The Nasdaq Composite has gained 23 % this year , but that 's largely due to the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks , which have soared 30 % .
Some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results .
`` People are naturally suspicious of them , '' says Mr. Mullins of Morgan Stanley .
Among his favorites in his firm 's index are Legent , Silicon Graphics and Novell .
However , more money managers are reassured that profit is regaining importance .
Mark Schoeppner , portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based Quaker Capital Management , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be `` valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the company can support . ''
Barney Hallingby , managing director of research at Hambrecht & Quist , also believes earnings growth is beginning to play a greater part in investors ' buying decisions .
On Friday , Hambrecht & Quist added St. Jude Medical to the list of 20 stocks it strongly recommends .
The opinion is largely based on the company 's earnings momentum , Mr. Hallingby says .
St. Jude 's market value on Nasdaq exceeds $ 1 billion , so it is n't a small stock .
The medical devices maker 's earnings rose nearly 35 % in 1987 from 1986 , and 75 % in 1988 .
Kurt Kruger , who follows the stock for Hambrecht & Quist , anticipates that the company 's net income will grow 51 % to $ 2.15 a share this year .
St. Jude finished up to 44 on Friday .

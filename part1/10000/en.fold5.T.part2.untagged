When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines .
The open-year accounting practice `` is widely recognized within Lloyd 's as of serious concern '' to the 31,329 member investors , who underwrite insurance at Lloyd 's in return for premium and investment income , Lloyd 's said .
As a result , the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open .
Under the new rules , the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from actuaries , including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably .

Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate John D. Rockefeller , Lake View Cemetery has fallen on hard times .
The ads celebrate the achievements of some of Lake View 's residents .
Another focuses on Charles Brush , the first person to light a city electrically .
Street lights , the ad points out , `` helped sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player . ''
Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery .
`` We do n't want to be known as ambulance chasers , '' says William Garrison , Lake View 's president .
A pleasant place to come and spend a few hours . ''
For example , President James A. Garfield is entombed here , the victim of an assassination in 1881 .
Mr. Rockefeller , buried beneath a 180-foot-tall granite obelisk , did n't seem right for an ad either .
But there are plenty of other promising prospects at Lake View , promoters believe : Ernest Ball , for instance , who wrote `` When Irish Eyes are Smiling , '' and Garrett Morgan , the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light .

Mr. Dempsey estimated that the issue 's London debut was accompanied by `` very , very heavy turnover -- between five million and six million shares . ''
Official trading in the shares will start in London , Paris and Brussels on Nov. 6 , when the French-franc denominated offering , valued at the equivalent of nearly $ 1 billion , comes to market in the European Community .
Because of the interest connected with the issue , the London exchange took the unusual step of letting traders establish an officially sanctioned when-issued market .
In contrast to the London performance , Euro Disney there closed down three francs yesterday , at 79 francs -LRB- $ 12.66 -RRB- bid , but still about 10 % over the 72-franc offering price .

The statement was part of a Ford filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .

He emphasized that the car maker only would bid for all of Jaguar under the right circumstances , and said `` those circumstances are n't right or possible at the moment . ''
Since then , Jaguar officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with GM and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month .
But the specter of Ford eventually launching a full-fledged bid could unravel the GM-Jaguar talks .
He predicted Ford officials will meet with Jaguar executives in the next week to outline their proposed offer .
As for GM , its `` fallback position has to be a full bid itself , '' said Stephen Reitman , European auto-industry analyst at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew .
They will have to throw their hat in the ring . ''
A pitched battle could mean Jaguar would fetch # 10 -LRB- $ 16.02 -RRB- a share , or about # 1.8 billion -LRB- $ 2.88 billion -RRB- , several analysts believe .
U.S. takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated 25 % of Jaguar shares .
In the U.S. , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents in over-the-counter trading , to $ 11.25 .
And financially strapped Jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know-how .
Ford 's need to acquire some or all of Jaguar became more acute last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its German-built Merkur Scorpio sedan as a European luxury import in the U.S .
GM 's interest in Jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the U.S. company 's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market .
GM officials also see a lot of potential in marrying Jaguar 's cars to the technological know-how of Group Lotus PLC , a British engineering and specialty car maker GM bought in 1986 .
Sun Co. also reported higher earnings .
Texaco 's exploration and production earnings improved as a result of its streamlining of those operations as it sold many of its marginal producing properties over the past 18 months .
The sale of a portion of refining and marketing operations to Saudi Arabia helped alleviate the decline in earnings from that business .
Third-quarter net income at Texaco rose to $ 305 million from $ 274 million last year .
Per-share earnings declined to $ 1.10 a share from $ 1.12 a share , largely because of 21 million additional shares issued to retire $ 1 billion of debt .
Sun Sun Co. 's net income climbed 18 % to $ 85 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 72 million , or 67 cents a share .
Sun said some of the growth reflects higher earnings in the oil sands operation of Suncor , a majority-owned Canadian subsidiary .
Overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the North Sea Magnus Field , a portion of which was acquired by Sun earlier this year .
Profits of Shell , a subsidiary of the Royal Group , tumbled $ 24 million , or 6.6 % , to $ 340 million , despite a gain of $ 30 million from an insurance settlement .

Two Japanese scientists said they discovered an antibody that , in laboratory test-tube experiments , kills AIDS-infected cells while preserving healthy cells .
The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it .
And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans .
The antibody then kills the cell .
In some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , the researchers said .
The two said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals .
Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they said .
But Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS-research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . ''

But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects .

Dr. Kitamura said about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests .
AZT is the world 's only prescription medicine approved for treating the disease .
A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan .

The United Kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $ 750 million purchase of a 15 % stake in UAL .
British Airways said its shareholders accepted only 6.3 % of the convertible capital bonds , but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters .
`` It is close to being a record undersubscription , '' said Bob Bucknell , an analyst with London broker Smith New Court Securities .
The obvious reason was -LRB- for British Air -RRB- to buy a stake in United Airlines . ''
But except for the embarrassment , British Air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue .
Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among U.K. institutional investors .
In any case , he added , `` most institutions probably wo n't sell '' the bonds .
`` From a cash flow point of view , British Airways is better off not being in United Airlines in the short term , '' said Andy Chambers , an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London .
For instance , British Air is continuing to negotiate with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines about each acquiring a 20 % stake in Sabena World Airlines , the air transport subsidiary of the Belgian national airline .
The failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on British Air shares .

Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden-Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union .
With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage points statewide .
Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .
Election analysts acknowledge that a `` Red-Green '' coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl 's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread .

As of June 30 , 1989 -- the day our past fiscal year came to a close -- only 4.1 % of the Bank 's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months .
Moreover , the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $ 800 million against possible loan losses .
Because of the business-like manner in which the Bank goes about development , financial markets have confidence in it .
Another of Mr. Roberts 's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development . ''
The reality is that Bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years .
By and large , these efforts have borne fruit .
Mr. Roberts also takes a swipe at the Bank 's adjustment lending .
The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years .
Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector .
Over the years , it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the International Finance Corp .
These are not the actions of a development agency wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government , as Mr. Roberts alleges .

The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms .
The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination .
In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated .
A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March .
The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants .

Ramada Inc. revised the terms of its restructuring and extended to Feb. 28 , 1990 , the deadline to complete the sale of its hotel business to New World Development Co. of Hong Kong and Prime Motor Inns Inc. of Fairfield , N.J .
Under the new terms , New World will still pay $ 540 million for Ramada 's hotel business , subject to adjustment at closing , but Ramada will now reimburse New World for $ 10 million in expenses .
Revised terms call for each Ramada common share to be exchanged for $ 1 in cash , subject to possible reduction , and one share of Aztar common stock .
The cash payout will be reduced by 40 % of any amount by which the weighted mean price of Ramada 's common stock exceeds $ 14 on the day the transaction closes .
Ramada 's stock rose 87.5 cents on the news to close at $ 11.25 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading .
The previous deadline to complete the sale was Nov. 30 .

The Des Moines-based publisher said it created a new Custom Marketing Group that will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines , such as Ladies Home Journal and Better Homes and Gardens .
Earlier this year , Meredith sold its first such package for $ 3 million to Kraft Inc. , now a unit of New York-based Philip Morris Cos .
Kraft recently agreed to spend an additional $ 3 million on similar programs through 1990 .
Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with Meredith said leading advertisers in consumer electronics , packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the Meredith group .
The New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its Golf Digest magazine .
Paul DuCharme , director of media services at Grey Advertising , said Meredith is the leader in providing multimedia packages .
Mr. Murphy of Meredith said one advertiser , which he would n't identify , wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines , publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase , give away a videotape on installation pointers , and possibly use Meredith 's Better Homes and Gardens ' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners .

Their `` secret '' is that they gather a small group of advisers around them , listen to what they have to say , prepare a business plan and they are on their way .
Unfortunately , they are in the minority .
It 's unfortunate so many must learn the hard way .
The management turnover at Reebok International Ltd. continued with the resignation of company president C. Joseph LaBonte , who joined Reebok just two years ago .
The resignations by the two executives , considered hard-charging and abrasive by Reebok insiders , reflect a difference in style with Paul Fireman , chairman and chief executive , according to several former executives .
The changes come as Reebok , which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late , is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals Nike Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc .
`` I think it 's more an issue of style .
The company can go about its business .
Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20 % decline last year .
Reebok said Mr. LaBonte will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc. , a California-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983 .
Reebok added that Mr. Fireman will assume the title of president .
`` We will not be commenting beyond the news release , '' the spokesman said .
Magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles .
At the American Magazine Conference here , publishers are plenty worried about the industry 's woes .
For example , Toronto-based Telemedia Inc. will publish Eating Well , a new food and health magazine due out next summer .
And Time Warner Inc. is developing a spinoff of Time magazine aimed at kids , on the heels of its successful Sports Illustrated for Kids .
`` This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry , '' said Mr. Kummerfeld .
And despite the recent tough advertising climate , industry figures released at the meeting here indicate things may be turning around .
Total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased 12 % to $ 4.6 billion .
Though some magazines are thriving , the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business .
Lang is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue .
Mr. Lipstein 's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble .
`` The magazine is strong .
`` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said James Autry , president of Meredith Corp. 's magazine group .
`` Magazines could , like other brands , find that they have only a limited life . ''
More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as American Express Publishing Corp. , a unit of American Express Co. , and Conde Nast Publications Inc. , a unit of Advance Publications Inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers .
Gerry Ritterman , president of New York-based Network Publishing Corp. , earlier this year sold his Soap Opera Digest magazine to Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
He would not reveal which magazines he is considering .
`` They could be old or new , but they are magazines whose editorial quality needs to be improved .
MCA Inc. said its toy-making unit agreed to buy Buddy L Corp. , producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products .

In June 1980 , Michele Sindona -- an Italian financier who in July 1972 had bought a 22 % block of Franklin 's stock from Loews Corp. , headed by Laurence A. Tisch -- was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and perjury .

A squiggly line snakes across a video screen , gyrating erratically as subjects with hand-held computers register their second-by-second reactions to a speaker 's remarks .
In another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how people 's opinions were shaped -- and how they can be reshaped .
He heads Litigation Sciences Inc. , the nation 's largest legal consulting firm , which is helping corporate America prepare for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions .
Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , Litigation Sciences , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC , employs more than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians .
Among other services , the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' jurors , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' juries , coaches lawyers and witnesses , and designs courtroom graphics .
With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time , companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice .
It advised the National Football League in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League .
Largely as a result , Litigation Sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years .
Meanwhile , competitors are being spawned almost daily ; some 300 new businesses -- many just one-person shops -- have sprung up .
In any high-stakes case , you can be sure that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants .
Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen .
After hours of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity .
Litigation consulting is , as New York trial attorney Donald Zoeller puts it , `` highly manipulative . ''
But the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally .
But Mr. Zoeller also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective .
Others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services .
Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases .
In that case , a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg .
The defense also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War .
Ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case .
The fledgling science went corporate in 1977 when International Business Machines Corp. hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case .
As the trial progressed , they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them .
He then briefed Messrs. Boies and Barr , who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation accordingly .
Mr. Vinson , the professor , got the law bug and formed Litigation Sciences .
`` The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , '' says Mr. Boies of Cravath , Swaine & Moore .
A shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . ''
Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow .
The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages .
`` It 's just like weather forecasting , '' says Energy Transportation trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins .
Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences ' work .
And to the uninitiated , some of the firm 's approaches may seem chillingly manipulative .
Instead , Mr. Vinson says , interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe-horn the facts of the case to fit their views .
If it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages , for example , depressed , underemployed people are far more likely to grant them .
So would someone recently divorced or widowed .
For personal-injury cases , Litigation Sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people , including victims , get what they deserve .
The consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books .
If a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will help find them .
They are what they are .
In our system of advocacy , the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can . ''
Logic plays a minimal role here .
In one personal-injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish .
The ploy worked .
In a classic defense of a personal-injury case , the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame .
Slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in Litigation Sciences ' operation .
Computer-generated videos help .
They are very visually sophisticated , '' explains LSI graphics specialist Robert Seltzer .
Supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics .
`` What you have here is intuition made manifest . ''
Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage .
Litigation Sciences concedes that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions .
Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick .
He says he used consultants in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . ''
And the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while undergoing such a skillful massage .
`` There 's no reason to believe that juries rule inappropriately , '' he says .
What you then do is you make them think inappropriately . ''
In most civil cases , judges allow each side three such challenges .
Mr. Etzioni also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors .
Furthermore , he says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities .
Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning -LRB- known as voir dire -RRB- or giving out personal information about the jurors .
Silicon Graphics Inc. , a fast-growing maker of computer workstations , said it landed two federal government contracts worth more than $ 100 million over the next five years .
The other involves the sale of about 35 of the company 's high-end workstations to the National Institutes of Health .
The awards are evidence that Silicon Graphics ' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers , analysts said .
`` No other -LCB- computer -RCB- vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price . ''
Silicon Graphics , on the other hand , has targeted a specific niche since its inception in 1982 , which has been dubbed by some as `` motion-picture computing . ''
Though Silicon Graphics is much smaller than Digital , Hewlett and Sun , it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market .
A year ago , Silicon Graphics introduced a model priced at $ 15,000 -- almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features .
`` It 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by 30 % to 40 % a year , '' said Edward McCracken , the company 's chief executive officer .

Remember those bulky , thick-walled refrigerators of 30 years ago ?
That something , whatever it is , could add as much as $ 100 to the $ 600 or so consumers now pay for lower-priced refrigerators .
In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual value of $ 135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB- .
The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0 .
That 's a lot of banishment , as it turns out .
Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows , upholstery and insulation .
But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ 100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants , foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes , the Montreal Protocol 's legions of supporters say it is worth it .
Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer .
In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time .
`` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently .
We ca n't afford to wait . ''
Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century .
Moreover , there are questions , particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best , about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer .
But ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture .
What scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year .
Moreover , surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems , running for many years without either the CFC gas or the insulation ever escaping .
Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none , so far , match the nonflammable , nontoxic CFCs .
Moreover , new lubricants will be needed to protect compressors from the new formulations , which , as with CFCs , are solvents .
Folks in the Midwest who just suffered a mid-October snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it , but let 's not be flippant about grave risks .
It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs .
Maybe we should ask why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement , giving it wide publicity , that it was withdrawing CFCs .
One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way .
Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one , and is building a plant in Louisiana to produce it .
There are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise .
University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . ''
In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few .
There is an element of make-work involved .
If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap .
but worries about 1990 .
Much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes -- from raising state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans .
Five states -- Oregon , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , Iowa and Wisconsin -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in 19 other states were defeated .
Iowa 's will be the second highest -- at $ 4.65 an hour in January 1992 -- but small-business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate .
The Illinois Legislature narrowly passed a parental-leave bill , which Gov. James Thompson vetoed , and Iowa and Tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for breast-cancer exams .
`` Those kinds of issues always keep coming back , '' says Robert Beckwith , who manages the Illinois Chamber of Commerce 's small-business office .
Only two states -- Vermont and Washington -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants .
But small business , which generally detests government-mandated benefits , has taken note of the growing number of close votes .
Consequently , small business is taking more `` pro-active '' steps to counter mandated leaves .
They also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave .
`` We 'll be playing a lot of defense , especially in the Midwest and Northeast , '' says Jim Buente of the NFIB .

CALIFORNIA , A TREND-SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy .
Previously , regulators insisted that franchisers pre-register such changes with the state -- a costly process taking at least six weeks .
For instance , franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who qualify as `` sophisticated purchasers . ''
But critics consider the changes regressive .
He argues California regulators historically have misinterpreted their law -- and he says negotiated sales that are n't pre-registered have been legal all along .

In other words , it was a better-than-average Manhattan commute .
The massive temblor , which killed at least 61 people , severed the Bay Bridge , a major artery to the east , and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101 , the biggest artery to the south .
But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm , gridlock never materialized , mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50 % more passengers than normal .
Moreover , the two main bridges still connecting San Francisco with the East Bay did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping .
Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge , which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span , actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday , provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations .
Not that getting into town was easy .
Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray , stranding commuters such as Marilyn Sullivan .
Yesterday , she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours , trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district .
`` I do n't know where all the buses are . ''
`` It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had , '' said Charles Catania , an insurance broker on the bus from Mill Valley in Marin County .
I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . ''
At the San Mateo Bridge , which connects the San Francisco peninsula with the East Bay , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved .
There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role .
Bechtel Group Inc. , the giant closely held engineering concern , says it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work .
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is offering its 6,000 San Francisco employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Some of the utility 's employees may opt for a four-day workweek , 10 hours a day , to cut the commute by 20 % .
Some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock .
But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last .
And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .
Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position .
And in the second game , with Mr. Kasparov advancing ferociously as white , D.T. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster .
Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26-year-old Soviet to beat the Pennsylvania-based computer , he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected .
As if he were Iron Mike , about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling , he declared : `` I 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years . ''
`` The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he said .
Its chief builder , Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu , nicknamed his brainchild `` the Weasel '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions .
In fact , D.T. never left home , Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link .
But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed kryptonite .
No human can examine millions of moves , but Mr. Kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones .
But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly .
`` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said Edmar Mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans .
It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T. 's knights .
Indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a `` tall pawn , '' as spectators snidely put it .
When most spectators thought its position hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , one-half of a pawn down .
While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost .
No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T.
Now , with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood , the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two .
As early as move six , Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight .
`` In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' Mr. Kasparov said later .
After only 11 moves for each side , the computer 's position was shaky .
And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats .
Now , after only a dozen moves , spectators were looking for a mating combination .
Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .
In a hopeless position , the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move .
`` In both games I got exactly what I wanted , '' he said .
Undeterred , D.T. 's handlers vowed to press on .
Promises Feng-hsiung Hsu : `` In three years we 'll mount a better challenge . ''
Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in .
In May 1986 , Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 % .
Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 % .
But nearly 3 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 .
Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value .
More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .
Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance .
Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured .
He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $ 100,000 , '' he adds .
Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect , too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk .
`` The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . ''
He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs -LRB- Treasury Income Growth Receipts -RRB- , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch .
The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York .
The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference... is not insured .
Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .
Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid .
`` It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , '' says Albert Disposti , a managing director of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc .
`` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . ''
Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 .
Merrill Lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs .
Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education .
But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured .
However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid .
Dr. Blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved .
No one else will watch out for you .

In the latest period , the company had an average of 370.8 million shares , 5.6 million shares below last year 's level .
Systemwide sales , which include sales at franchisee as well as company-owned stores , totaled $ 4.59 billion compared with $ 4.2 billion .

That ship , which would carry about 2,050 passengers , would expand the capacity of Carnival 's existing 14-ship fleet by 24 % .
`` There 's a 99 % chance that the Fantasy will be delivered close to schedule , '' said Caroline Levy , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
She said the company could pay as much as 25 % more for the ships .
Analysts said those estimates -- which range from about $ 1.80 a share to $ 1.95 a share -- are based on Fantasy being in operation in 1990 .
Analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money Carnival might lose through deposits .
Carnival , for example , has already paid about $ 160 million of the total cost for Fantasy .
According to reports from Finland , Waertsilae Marine , 19%-owned by conglomerate Oy Waertsilae , filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard 's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees .
Designer Sandra Garratt filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code protection , saying that her cash flow had been cut off .
Ms. Garratt was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in March .
Jerell paid Ms. Garratt royalties for the line known as Multiples by Sandra Garratt , which are sold primarily through department stores .
That lawsuit is still pending .
Ms. Garratt 's assets and liabilities were n't disclosed .
Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates , leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels , said Stephen R. Hardis , vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer .
Third-quarter net was $ 40 million , or $ 1.04 a share , from $ 54.4 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year ago .
The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales did n't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do , said Patrick E. Sheridan , analyst with McDonald & Co .
Eli Lustgarten of PaineWebber Inc. , who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $ 5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market , says he will make another cut to about $ 5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report .
Eaton said sales of truck axles , transmissions and other parts fell 7.2 % to $ 295 million .
Eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category , but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell 26 % to $ 51 million on an about 1 % drop in sales to $ 488 million .
The truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods , he said , and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral .
The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market .
Eaton earned from continuing operations $ 165.1 million , or $ 4.40 a share , down 7 % from $ 177.5 million , or $ 4.76 a share , a year earlier .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Eaton closed at $ 57.50 a share , down $ 2.50 .
Initial steps were taken at Poland 's first international environmental conference , which I attended last month .
The conference was entitled `` Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection , '' a significant departure from East Bloc usage , which recognizes only one economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior .
Why did East Bloc participants unanimously endorse market-based pollution approaches ?
Like other East Bloc countries , Poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance .
Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions .
Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled .
Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average .
Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from -LRB- a -RRB- Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; -LRB- b -RRB- planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and -LRB- c -RRB- the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West .
The solutions they formally proposed included taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
A revolution takes more than conference manifestos .
The Russians are talking peace .
And the Poles are engaged in commerce . ''
Those implications include : -- Privatization
Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries .
-- Least-cost solutions .
That means simple , clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction , deferring more complex issues such as risk .
That 's because quota-trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals .
Even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars .
-- Democratization .
While Polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information .
-- Global reciprocity .
His point : It will be increasingly difficult for the U.S. to cling to command-and-control measures if even the East Bloc steps to a different drummer .
But the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy .
Disappointing earnings news from some technology companies unnerved investors in the over-the-counter market , who sold shares of Apple Computer , Intel and many other computer-related concerns .
It finished at 467.22 , down 3.45 .
Mostly because of the sell-off in technology stocks , the Nasdaq 100 Index of the OTC 's largest non-financial issues dropped 4.58 to 457.52 .
Some traders said the sell-off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by investors .
`` It 's a quiet retreat , '' said Mr. Howley .
Some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies , he said .
Yesterday 's volume of 117.2 million shares was far below last week 's sizzling average of nearly 177 million .
Apple Computer , which reported lackluster earnings Friday , lost 1 to 46 on 1.1 million shares .
Investors apparently did n't like the news from Rainbow Technologies either .
Rainbow 's stock dropped 2 to 14 .
Microsoft , which last week rose to a record , fell victim to profit-taking , traders said , as it declined 2 to 83 .
Among takeover stocks , Jefferson Smurfit jumped 1 to 42 after SIBV-MS Holdings said the price to be paid to Jefferson Smurfit 's minority holders has been raised to $ 43 a share .
SIBV-MS Holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of Jefferson Smurfit and a Morgan Stanley limited partnership .
These shares will be bought by SIBV-MS Holdings at $ 41.75 each after the acquisition of the minority shares .
LIN 's suitor , McCaw Cellular Communications , dropped 1 to 40 on almost 350,000 shares .
They say investors will favor companies that historically have posted annual earnings growth of 15 % to 20 % .
Michael R. Weisberg , partner in charge of research at Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco , said some investors have already made the switch .
The rise matches that of the Dow Jones industrials this year .
He predicted that the most popular growth companies will be those with `` some kind of unique product or franchise '' that makes them appear able to sustain their momentum .
Nellcor , a maker of electronic patient monitoring systems , was up to 16 on 258,000 shares yesterday , while retailing issue Office Club was unchanged at 10 on 65,200 shares .
Other favorites of growth-stock analysts and money managers also had a mixed session .
But Legent , a systems software stock , was down to 29 on 39,300 shares .
Elsewhere , Valley National continued its slide , dropping 2 to 15 on 1.7 million shares .
Higher earnings helped some issues .
Why ca n't we teach our children to read , write and reckon ?
It 's that we do n't want to .
These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .
If I were to ask a sample of American parents , `` Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course . ''
No one can say .
The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive .
Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy .
The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way .
`` Progressive education '' -LRB- as it was once called -RRB- is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction .
It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses .
I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .
But they need not be to do their jobs well .
But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious .
If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place .
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis .
It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency .
If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message .
We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking .
They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them .
A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need .
Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program .
Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea .
Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school .
If parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another .
Here , the experience of New York City is decisive .
New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it .
The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers .
That is the way the system works .
No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago .
The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic '' is absurd .
No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential .
The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial .
One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods .
-- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline .
With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability .
This is a fact -- though , in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact , it is not surprising that one hears so little about it .
International Business Machines Corp. unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when computerizing their operations : Most machines ca n't talk to each other .
The aim , ultimately , is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning , marketing and other operations .
But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines , including robots and machine tools .
Consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the IBM strategy to fall into place , even though the specific products IBM unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter .
He said he believes IBM 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology .
IBM 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing .
IBM 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that IBM has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems .
`` We may not have every manufacturing problem , but we have most , '' said George Conrades , IBM 's top marketing official .
Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms -- Nomura Securities Co. , Daiwa Securities Co. , Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities -- also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year ending March 31 , replacing the 12-month term formerly finishing Sept. 30 .
Operating profit , pretax profit and net income results , however , were provided for the immediately preceding six-month period .
Nomura said its pretax profits inched up 0.9 % to 248.91 billion yen -LRB- US$ 1.75 billion -RRB- from 246.60 billion yen in the six months ended March 31 .
Net income , however , rose 3.7 % to 107.87 billion yen from 103.98 billion yen .
Daiwa said its pretax profits surged 9.6 % to 171.04 billion yen from 156.12 billion yen in the preceding six-month term .
Net income jumped 21 % to 79.03 billion yen from 65.53 billion yen .
Yamaichi said its pretax profit increased 8.9 % to 117.94 billion yen from 108.28 billion yen .
Net income surged 21 % to 55.59 billion yen from 46.02 billion yen .
Nikko 's pretax profit rose 1.6 % to 130.25 billion yen from 128.19 billion yen .
Net income rose 23 % to 63.52 billion yen from 51.65 billion yen .
Harken Energy Corp. of Dallas said it will drop its $ 11.75-a-share , or $ 190 million , offer for Tesoro Petroleum Corp. if the two companies do n't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15 .
Harken also said that its financing from Bankers Trust Co. has been extended until Dec. 15 to give Tesoro 's board time to consider the offer at a Tesoro board meeting scheduled for mid-November .
However , Tesoro , based in Houston , already has rejected a suitor in the past year .
He succeeds Paul J. Montle , 42 , who will remain chairman .
National Environmental , formerly Yankee Cos. , is a sludge treatment company .
Under the accord , Albert Roth , chairman and chief executive officer , and Arthur Chase , Sam Beigel , and Louis Polsky will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer .
Mr. Lurie is currently co-chief executive .
Eagle also said it received a commitment for as much as $ 8 million in financing from Norfolk Capital Group Inc .
A committee representing the unsecured creditors agreed to accept 24 cents on the dollar , Eagle said .
It would extinguish all of Eagle 's existing capital stock and issue new stock to York as sole holder .
In its bankruptcy-law petition , filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , Eagle said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender , Bankers Trust Co. , reduced its credit line .
Eagle 's management retired and Biny 's management took control of the company .
But Eagle said the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged .
Standard & Poor 's Corp. said it would add John H. Harland Co. , an Atlanta check printer , to its 500-stock index , effective at the close of trading on Wednesday .

Largely to meet tougher new capital requirements , thrifts reduced their assets $ 13.4 billion in August , by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans .
As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in August , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits .
It was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets , the Office of Thrift Supervision said .
`` The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant in Alexandria , Va .
James Barth , an economist with the Office of Thrift Supervision , also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors .
`` That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry . ''
For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion .
As of Aug. 31 , thrifts held $ 185 billion in mortgage-backed securities .
Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink .
For the first eight months of 1989 , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 44.5 billion .
The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth .
If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP .
In the early 1980s , I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade .
There has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981 .
The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period , but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated .
This bias is in no way deliberate .
The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates -LRB- mainly employment or hours -RRB- instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data .
In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s .
The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well .
Because finance and services contribute 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year .
I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product .
In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed .
In sum , the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP .
In other words , the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about 20 % .

Net was $ 139 million , or 98 cents a share , for the quarter , compared with $ 213 million , or $ 1.56 a share , a year ago .
Carbide , like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry , was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter .
`` It certainly was n't a disaster , but it does show weakness '' in some of the company 's chief markets , said George Krug , a chemicals-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co .
Prices for polyethylene , a common plastic and an important Carbide product , started to fall early this year ; the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories .
Some producers of polyethylene , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts .
A Carbide spokesman said `` the conditions are right for the increase to hold . ''
Operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million .
The latest quarter included a gain of about $ 62 million on the sale of the company 's urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses .
That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business .
For the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74 a share , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71 a share , a year ago .
At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders .
Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico .
These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon .
Officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel .
Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties .
Ohio , the District of Columbia , Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions .
It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking .
Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the states .
`` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel .
While Ms. Bryant 's state went ahead and accepted Drexel 's settlement offer of $ 25,000 , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions .
Similarly , Alfred Rubega , New Hampshire 's director of securities regulation , said his state had n't received any complaints about Drexel , so it really could n't press the issue .
Mr. Cohen , the Drexel general counsel , said , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be losing any licenses . ''
Mr. Cohen said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million .
`` The rate we 're going , I think that by the end of the month , we 're looking to have a total of 30 to 35 , '' he said .
The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry .
There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling .
New Jersey , for example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused .
The state can also bar Drexel as an investment adviser .
Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license .
`` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said .
Particularly touchy are the cases of New York , which is Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties .
But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials .
Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing .
`` We need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again . ''
Time Warner Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 176 million , or $ 2.88 cents a share , reflecting acquisition costs for a 59.3 % stake in Warner Communications Inc. and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction .
Time Warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining Warner shares .
On a pro-forma basis , assuming the merger was effective Jan 1 , 1988 , including the results from both Time Inc. and all of Warner , that cash flow figure would be $ 526 million for the latest quarter , more than double the comparable figure a year ago , or $ 242 million , according to Time Warner .
`` What really matters is the operating income of the divisions : I look at these numbers and I say , these businesses are doing well , '' said Mark Manson , a vice president of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
That 's a big number .
In the year-ago third quarter , Time on its own reported net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1.42 a share .
On a pro forma basis , including all of Warner 's earnings , Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $ 217 million , compared with a $ 342 million loss a year earlier .
For the third quarter , Warner 's $ 106 million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $ 113 million , or 90 cents a share .
The 1988 figures were restated to include the results of Lorimar Telepictures Corp. , which Warner acquired in January .
`` Batman '' alone has racked up more than $ 247 million in box-office receipts to date , making it Warner Bros . ' largest grossing film ever .
Warner also contributed record results from its music business , where unit sales of compact discs rose more than 50 % from a year ago , the company said , helped by Prince 's `` Batman '' soundtrack .
In addition , the 1988 results included a $ 20 million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at American Television & Communications Corp .
In magazines , higher advertising revenues at Sports Illustrated and Fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Time Warner closed at $ 138.625 a share , up $ 1.875 , while Warner closed at $ 63.875 a share , up 12.5 cents .
William S. Leavitt , chairman , said Mr. Penn , 58 years old , would continue as a consultant and would work with the board in selecting a successor .
The company said it would have no further comment .
His father , David S. Leavitt , was chairman and chief executive until his death in an accident five years ago , at which time Mr. Penn was named president .
Four Democrats on the House Banking Committee sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of James Simmons , an Arizona banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. Bush , to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp .
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp are members of the board .
An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons , the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way .
Mr. Simmons declined to comment , and the White House said the congressmen 's letter is under review .
Both banks have been battered , as have other Arizona banks , by falling real estate prices .
`` We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key RTC appointment , '' the letter said .
But Mr. Simmons has long ties to both Republicans and banking .
The two met more than 30 years ago , when Mr. Simmons worked for Commercial Bank & Trust Co. of Midland , Texas , where Mr. Bush was an organizing director .
That committee determined to open Arizona to banking across state lines .
The letter to Mr. Bush was signed by Reps. Bruce Vento -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , the chairman of the Banking Committee 's RTC Task Force , Thomas McMillen -LRB- D. , Md. -RRB- , Kweisi Mfume -LRB- D. , Md . -RRB- and Paul Kanjorski -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- .
Mr. McElroy , 54 years old , will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit .
Mr. Werner , 58 , was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit .
The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance .
Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes .
Visitors are ushered into the premises by red-frocked doormen known as waiters , a reminder of the insurance market 's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century London .
Lloyd 's , once a pillar of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation .
At the same time , Lloyd 's is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business .
`` Lloyd 's is on the ropes , '' says Peter Nutting , a Lloyd 's investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence .
It needs to sort itself out . ''
Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year , more than triple the number of resignations in 1987 .
Lackluster returns are one reason .
In 1985 , it was 2.1 % .
Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability .
And catastrophes are getting ever more costly .
During the five-year period ended 1986 , roughly 80 % of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates , according to Chatset consultants .
`` I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that 's how bad it is , '' Betty Atkins , a secretary from suburban London , says .
Ms. Atkins , who underwrote # 20,000 , or about $ 32,000 , of insurance coverage on that syndicate , now faces potential losses of roughly # 70,000 , or $ 111,000 .
Unease is widespread among exchange members .
The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ''
Meanwhile , competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying .
Over the past decade , competitors have chipped away at the exchange 's share of the # 2.5 billion marine market in London , where half the world 's ships are insured .
The official asked not to be named . -RRB-
Lloyd 's has endured decades of genteel decline .
It virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe .
Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . -RRB-
Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now-standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business .
Even Lloyd 's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged .
But since 1981 , Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington , Ky. has grabbed a 20 % stake of the market .
Thus , he asserts , Lloyd 's ca n't react quickly to competition .
They are n't controlling their destiny like they used to . ''
`` This is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead , '' he says .
Lloyd 's , he says , is cut off from `` the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence '' against catastrophic losses .
The exchange , he says , must find new products and new markets .
Tradition is dictator at Lloyd 's .
Some exchange wags call the building `` the oil rig . '' -RRB-
The Lloyd 's market actively underwrites insurance just 4 hours a day , brokers say .
A two-hour lunch break follows .
Lloyd 's vast trading hall houses a warren of well-polished desks .
Sandwiched between desks , underwriters sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies .
A broker may have to approach as many as 20 underwriters who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates .
`` The system , '' says Nicholas Samengo-Turner , a Lloyd 's broker who left the exchange in 1985 , `` is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad . ''
John Wetherell , a Lloyd 's underwriter , says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50 % the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985 .
Lloyd 's officials decline to comment on the matter .
Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further .
The magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims .
That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .
Insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $ 600 million in aviation losses -LRB- including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie , Scotland -RRB- and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September 's Hurricane Hugo .
Mr. Lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names .
It recently cut its work force by 9 % , or 213 . -RRB-
Mr. Wetherell , the underwriter , reckons half of his business could be transacted by computer , cutting costs at least 10 % .
Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information .
Lloyd 's overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies .
Lloyd 's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada .
The proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand .
Mr. Lawrence says the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims .
Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co. named Masahiro Dozen president .
Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa , Japan 's second-largest securities firm .
The title of chief executive officer is n't used .
It was only earlier this year that the jovial , easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president .
Daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms .
For the six months ended Sept. 30 , Daiwa reported unconsolidated -LRB- parent company -RRB- net income of 79.03 billion yen -LRB- $ 556.5 million -RRB- on revenue of 332.38 billion yen -LRB- $ 2.34 billion -RRB- .
Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen 's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan 's domestic markets , which should mean increased competition .
While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the U.S .
And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months , they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors .
Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand .
`` He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said Koji Yoneyama , president of Daiwa 's U.S. unit .
By his own account , Mr. Dozen did n't do much better with U.S. bonds .
But he could n't sell any .
Maybe it 's crazy , '' he said .
Upon returning to New York , `` Exhausted , I got into a taxicab , and the woman driver said : ` Americans make better fishermen , ' '' he recalled .
He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions .
Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959 .
In his climb to the top , Mr. Dozen also headed the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income units and its international operations .
But it Mr. Dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales force -- to accede to the presidency .
And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force `` would be fragile , '' said a Daiwa executive .
`` He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball , like a farmer , '' said Mr. Yoneyama .
The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8 % of its common outstanding .
Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend .
Some analysts said Inco , which had cash reserves of $ 272 million as of Sept. 30 , could still announce a special dividend in the next few months , though it would be smaller than the $ 10-a-share special dividend it paid last year .
Inco 's net fell to $ 129.3 million , or $ 1.23 a share , in the third quarter from $ 200.3 million , or $ 1.88 a share , a year earlier .
Excluding special gains from tax-loss carry-forwards , earnings in the latest quarter were $ 117.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share , compared with $ 187.4 million , or $ 1.76 a share .
Inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next 12 months if nickel market conditions are favorable .
UAL Corp. 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying United Airlines ' parent should remain independent for now .
The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility .
Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC , the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support .
UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement .
The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal .
But the board said it was n't interested for now .
The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan .
The directors signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . ''
The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong , viable , independent company . ''
He also vowed to `` make every effort to nurture... a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups . ''
Labor problems top the list .
In return for an ownership stake in the company , the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted .
As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft .
The union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort `` still need to be addressed . ''
The machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction .
The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out .
His credibility is also on the line in the investment community .
But he and his chief financial officer , John Pope , sowed some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options .
It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits .
One takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote .
Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , whose $ 240-a-share offer for UAL in August triggered a bidding war , says he remains interested in the airline .
Essentially , he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ 300 a share .
Tandy 's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories .
Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development .
Those chips were in dire shortage last year , hurting many U.S. computer companies that could n't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips .
`` At this time , we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need -LCB- for DRAMs -RCB- from the market as a rule , '' said Ed Juge , Tandy 's director of market planning .
`` I would like to have had them , '' he said .
Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June , when the group was formed by seven electronics companies : Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. ; Hewlett-Packard Co. ; Intel Corp. ; International Business Machines Corp. ; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp .
U.S. Memories needs a catalyst , he said , to inspire others to join .
Sun Microsystems Inc. said it 's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week .
Personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. said it is still studying the situation .
In a startling turnabout , Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them .
With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the leakers are performing a public service .
What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry .
But there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue .
The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega .
The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity .
For example , what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations ?
Mr. Noriega did n't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol .
Or maybe a Surgeon General 's warning : Confiding in the United States may be fatal .
The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point .
In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA .
And of course , doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties .
The Intelligence Committee 's ranking Republican , Senator William Cohen , joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra , deploring `` Men of Zeal . ''
What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail ?
The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action .
There are of course good reasons the U.S. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars .
In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility .
As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi .
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him .
Mr. Katz happily agreed , sliding over the fact that California 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes .
Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch .
There were no immediate reports of deaths , but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night .
One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant 's reactors .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Phillips Petroleum shares fell $ 1.125 to $ 23.125 .
The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel , where about 150 companies have operations , because the thick , black smoke obscured the area .
Broken water lines and gas leaks hindered firefighters ' efforts , but by late yesterday authorities said they had the fire under control .
The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston , about 10 miles away .
The injured , including three in critical condition , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said .
The number working at the time of the blast was n't known .
In late August , four contract workers were injured and one Phillips employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility 's boiler house .
Plastics are the cornerstone of Phillips ' chemicals operations , which is the biggest single contributor to the company 's profits .
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law .
In the suit , filed in June 1988 , the government accused the union 's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering .
U.S. District Judge David Edelstein also permanently enjoined Mr. Lombardo from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union .
Exxon Corp. said its third-quarter earnings slipped 9 % as profits from two of its three major businesses sagged .
Phillips Petroleum Co. and Atlantic Richfield Co. also reported declines in quarterly profit , while Ashland Oil Inc. posted a loss for the latest quarter .
Although Exxon spent heavily during the latest quarter to clean up the Alaskan shoreline blackened by its huge oil spill , those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing spill-related program are covered by $ 880 million in charges taken during the first half .
She added , however , that charges already taken do n't take into account the potential effect of litigation involving the oil spill .
Exxon 's net income during the third quarter dropped to $ 1.11 billion , or 87 cents a share , from $ 1.22 billion , or 93 cents a share , a year earlier .
During the third quarter , Exxon purchased 8.34 million shares of its stock at a cost of $ 373 million .
Exxon 's earnings from chemicals operations fell $ 90 million , to $ 254 million , while refining and marketing profits declined $ 180 million , to $ 357 million .
He estimates that the price of West Texas Intermediate , the U.S. benchmark crude , was $ 4.04 a barrel higher during the third quarter of this year than in the same period last year .
A year earlier , the refiner earned $ 66 million , or $ 1.19 a share .
For the year , net income tumbled 61 % to $ 86 million , or $ 1.55 a share .
In September , Ashland settled the long-simmering dispute by agreeing to pay Iran $ 325 million .
The oil refiner also booked a $ 15 million charge for selling Ashland Technology Corp. , one of its subsidiaries , at a loss .
Revenue climbed 28 % , to $ 1.18 billion from $ 925 million .
Refining and marketing earnings climbed to $ 33.3 million from $ 12.9 million , and exploration and production earnings rose to $ 37.1 million from $ 17.9 million .
It is widely known within industry circles that Hess had to buy oil products in the high-priced spot markets to continue supplying its customers .
Phillips Petroleum 's third-quarter earnings slid 60 % , to $ 87 million , or 36 cents a share , from $ 215 million , or 89 cents a share .
Shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline , said Chairman C.J. Silas in a statement .
A year ago , results were buoyed by a $ 20 million after-tax gain from an asset sale .
The latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $ 71 million from non-recurring items .
The latest period included a $ 54 million gain from the sale of various oil and gas properties , a $ 22 million charge from the restructuring of Occidental 's domestic oil and gas operations , and tax credits of $ 42 million .
Occidental said oil and gas earnings fell to $ 17 million from $ 20 million .
Chemical earnings fell 10 % , reflecting softening of demand .
Sales fell 20 % , to $ 3.7 billion from $ 4.6 billion .
Offsetting the lower stake in Lyondell were higher crude oil prices , increased natural gas volumes and higher coke prices , the company said .
For the nine months , Arco reported net income of $ 1.6 billion , or $ 8.87 a share , up 33 % from $ 1.2 billion or $ 6.56 a share a year earlier .

He suggested that investors buy the shares of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea , J. Baker , McDonald 's , Philip Morris and Sara Lee .
McDonald 's has long-term debt equaling 91 % of shareholder equity currently , but Mr. Kerschner said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $ 2.6 billion below their real value .

Who 'd have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents ?
At his old job in Compton , Calif. , he took a bitter teachers ' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member .
In New York City , the new Chancellor , Joseph Fernandez , has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform .
Former Patterson , N.J. , principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public 's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator .
He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline , but is n't it interesting that some of the country 's biggest , most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold ?
Mr. Fernandez does n't take control in New York until January , but already he 's roiling the waters .
It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals .
One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years , despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work .
Naturally , the principals ' union loves building tenure , and tenure has withstood previous challenge .
In his old job , as Dade County chief , Mr. Fernandez forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals .
But the no-more-nonsense superintendents are going to have to be judicious as well ; incompetent principals and administrators should go , but the good ones ought to be left alone .
He takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform .
This of course led to disaster in New York City .
The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems .
The classroom itself operated on the periphery of this awful system , discipline collapsed , and kids stopped learning .
Until then , it 's clear that some of the people who 've been keeping big-city schools down are going to be dealing with the Terminator .
As part of the agreement , Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson 's 66 newspapers , ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently .
Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 .
Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers .
Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 .
Industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high , causing a strain on Goodson 's finances .
David N. Hurwitz , president and chief operating officer of Goodson , said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers .
The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll .
But in recent years , Mr. Ingersoll began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg , Pincus & Co .
The company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year .
Mr. Goodson , in his own statement , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over the past few years , it has become increasingly clear that Ralph and I have different agendas , '' and that he feels `` more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the Goodson papers .
Mr. Roman , 59 years old , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is American Express , to become American Express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications .
Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra .
The company later apologized and agreed to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him .
Ad industry executives were n't surprised by Mr. Roman 's decision to leave Ogilvy .
And although Mr. Roman and WPP 's chief executive , Martin Sorrell , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , people close to Mr. Roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company .
Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy 's flagship ad agency , Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide , by Graham Phillips , 50 , who had been president of North American operations and who , like Mr. Sorrell , is British .
He had been president of the international operations .
Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express job .
Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident .
Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years , Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson .
But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine -LRB- The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client -RRB- .
The implication that I was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' Mr. Roman said .
Mr. Roman said American Express 's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September .
Although it ultimately was n't offered to him , he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters .
It was my decision , not anyone else 's . ''
The two executives could hardly be more different .
During time off , Mr. Roman tends to his garden ; Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for , among other things , fast cars and planes .
I 'm the guy who made him head of New York , head of the U.S. , president of North America , and recommended him -LCB- to Mr. Sorrell -RCB- as my successor .
He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips 's boat in Connecticut .
`` I consider this a second career , '' he said .
Mr. Roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy .
`` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods .
`` Ken was my key contact , '' said J. Nicholas Hahn , president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc. , which represents cotton producers .
I have n't seen or talked to him in several years . ''
While the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including Maxwell House .
I think they need creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said Emma Hill , an analyst with Wertheim & Co .
`` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill .
`` Graham Phillips has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. Sorrell , said Andrew Wallach , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert .
Hopefully , he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in New York . ''
Computer Sciences Corp. , El Segundo , Calif. , said it is close to making final an agreement to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates from Saatchi & Saatchi

The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters .
Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit .
But he said Turner Broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the U.S .
Turner has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years , but the company has never acted as a full-fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters .
The Turner move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films .
In a sign the stock slump has n't quieted Europe 's takeover fever , Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to bid for one of France 's other large financial and industrial holding companies , Cie. de Navigation Mixte .
Its cash-or-shares bid values Navigation Mixte at about 22.82 billion francs -LRB- $ 3.62 billion -RRB- , making this one of France 's largest-ever attempted takeovers .
The move would greatly boost Paribas 's stake in the insurance , transport and food businesses , where Navigation Mixte is strong .
Allianz holds a 50 % stake in Navigation Mixte 's insurance interests , acquired three weeks ago .
Long considered a potential takeover target , Navigation Mixte had hoped Allianz would help protect it from raiders .
Paribas is Allianz 's main French bank , and the Munich-based group said it intends to stay neutral .
But Navigation Mixte is loosely held and hard to defend .
Who would bid against Paribas ? ''
Last month , Paribas 's archrival , Cie . Financiere de Suez , won a battle for Groupe Victoire , France 's second-largest private-sector insurer , which itself had just acquired West Germany 's Colonia Versicherung AG .
Moreover , Suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of Societe Generale de Belgique .
Although Paribas denies it , analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between France 's two largest investment banking groups .
Although Paribas Chairman Michel Francois-Poncet would n't rule out eventually selling all of Navigation Mixte 's insurance operations to Allianz , he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate .
Navigation Mixte has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a bakery and bus and trucking firms , among others .
Payment by Allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the French concern 's treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs .
Alternatively , it said it would offer three Paribas shares , themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1 , for one Navigation Mixte share .
Paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it .
Some financial sources said privately that Paribas blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group , bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price .
When notoriously independent-minded Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier rejected Paribas 's offer and began buying Paribas shares in retaliation , Mr. Francois-Poncet said , he felt obliged to bid for control .
A bid against Paribas could n't be ruled out .
Analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its officials could n't be reached .
In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell 39 cents a barrel to $ 19.76 for December delivery .
Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day , with some accounts putting the 13-nation group 's output as high as 23 million barrels a day .
But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market participants say , OPEC production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further .
With prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices .
The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products .
Dozens of workers were injured , authorities said .
Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices .
`` Our technician is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ 20 , '' he said .
The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $ 1.1960 .
The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in .
According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts .
Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the U.S. copper market .
`` The sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong , '' he said .
Mr. Savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $ 1.04 .
January platinum closed down $ 2.80 an ounce at $ 486.30 , nearly $ 4 above its low for the day .
Platinum is believed to have good support around $ 480 and palladium at around $ 130 .
Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters .
He said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again .
Many analysts believe that the Soviets ' thirst for dollars this year to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much .
On the Chicago Board of Trade , soybeans for November delivery closed at $ 5.63 a bushel , down half a cent , while the December wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $ 4.0775 a bushel .
But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt .
SUGAR : World prices tumbled , mostly from their own weight , according to analysts .
For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan .
Developing countries such as India , some analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents .
A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country .
The December contract rose $ 33 a metric ton to $ 1,027 , near its high for the day .
Market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns , which in the past have preceded sharp rallies .
At such prices , according to Mr. Savaiko , bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators is n't uncommon .
He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move .
Rockwell International Corp. bought out Ikegai Corp. 's interest in Ikegai-Goss , a joint venture of the two companies based in Tokyo .
The agreement provides that Ikegai Corp. will remain a supplier to Ikegai-Goss , which makes printing presses for the newspaper industry .
Ikegai-Goss , which has about 200 employees , is among the industry leaders in keyless inking technology , which reduces time and materials waste when preparing a press for printing .
Early in the day , bonds rose modestly on economists ' forecasts that this week 's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble .
For example , today the Department of Commerce is scheduled to release the September durable goods report .
That would follow a 3.9 % advance in August .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 .
`` When you get a big sell-off in equities , money starts to shift into bonds , '' which are considered safer , he said .
Municipals ended mixed , while mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose .
In more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk bonds , a $ 150 million issue by Imo Industries Inc. was snapped up by investors while underwriters for Beatrice Co. 's $ 350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers .
`` On the negative side , the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said William M. Brachfeld , economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc .
We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said .
Tomorrow , Resolution Funding Corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction .
The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history .
The issue yields 8.90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from the company .
The issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year Treasurys .
Treasury bonds were to point higher yesterday in light trading .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 to yield 7.97 % .
Short-term rates rose yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction , compared with the previous bill sale .
The $ 7.81 billion of six-month Treasury bills were sold with an average discount rate of 7.50 % , the highest since the average of 7.60 % at the Oct. 10 auction .
Here are auction details : Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
The 13-week bills mature Jan. 25 , 1990 , and the 26-week bills mature April 26 , 1990 .
In the junk bond market , Imo Industries ' issue of 12-year debentures , considered to be one of the market 's high-quality credits , was priced at par to yield 12 % .
`` It 's a segmented market , and if you have a good , strong credit , people have an appetite for it , '' he said .
In light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market , junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors .
Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys .
Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 % and 13 % .
The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $ 1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues , and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $ 250 million Remic backed by 9 % 15-year securities .
Traders said thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks .
Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 , up ; and Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 , up .
A $ 575 million San Antonio , Texas , electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector .
But alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market , where prices were off to up point .
He attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace .
A $ 137.6 million Maryland Stadium Authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared to be off to a good start .
Activity quieted in the New York City bond market , where heavy investor selling last week drove yields on the issuer 's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point .
The turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about Japan 's bond market .
The yield rose to 5.38 % .
The benchmark 7 % bond due October 1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.80 to yield 7.03 % , while the 6 % notes due July 1994 fell 0.10 to 97.65 to yield 7.34 % .
The benchmark 11 % Treasury bond due rose to 111 to yield 10.11 % , while the 12 % issue of 1995 rose to 103 to yield 11.01 % .
The husky blond guide with the Aggie cap twists his face in mock fury .
He has two more years at Texas A&M .
There have been three days of hot , wind-swept rain , and now with the first sun we are after speckled seatrout , which with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts .
Negative answers crackle back .
We go from one to the other .
The great silver clouds on the horizon build themselves on the pale water .
The guide scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook .
Just wait for that tap-tap , that thump-thump .
Do n't forget , trout have very soft mouths . ''
`` Pickin ' one or two , '' says the guide , chuckling .

This must be the last big stretch of the American seacoast that is `` undeveloped . ''
People are not apt to be self-conscious about the place or themselves .
Jutting out just to the north of us is the Blackjack Peninsula -LRB- after the oak , not the game -RRB- which forms the core of the Aransas Wildlife Refuge .
Last year a gunner shot a whooper by mistake thinking that it was a snow goose .
The peninsula comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see .
Deer , wild hog , armadillos and alligators are the glamour quadrupeds and the birds are innumerable , especially the herons and the spoonbills .
Inland a few miles from the refuge there is a place called Tivoli , with a white church , a gas station and a grocery , the houses relatively close together for such a settlement in these parts .
`` Here in south Texas we say Tie-vole-ee , '' my host gently corrects .
AEG AG and Siemens AG said they will launch their previously announced joint venture for power semiconductors in January .
AEG and Siemens each will hold a 50 % stake in the venture .
It will develop , produce and market high-performance electronic parts .
AEG is 80 % owned by Daimler-Benz AG , the country 's biggest industrial concern .
Sales dropped 4 % to $ 1.12 billion from $ 1.17 billion .
The Venezuelan currency plummeted this year , making it difficult for auto makers there to afford imported parts .
The company , based in Toledo , Ohio , had said it expected reduced third-quarter profit .
Southwood J. Morcott , Dana 's president , said the company 's decision to approve its normal fourth-quarter dividend indicated its underlying strength .
Mr. Furuta did n't disclose further details of the arrangement at a news conference , but said the project would be undertaken with Ford 's European subsidiary .
At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal .
It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas .
And , for Ms. Baker , the ride was far from over .
Bricktop , another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris , said : `` I do n't think I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than Josephine 's . ''
Baker had lots of them .
As she saw one key love affair , the problem was n't her infidelity , it was his jealousy .
She adopted 12 of assorted races , naming them the Rainbow Tribe , and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina .
Friends pitched in .
Another lifelong complication , as Phyllis Rose makes clear in `` Jazz Cleopatra : Josephine Baker in Her Time '' -LRB- Doubleday , 321 pages , $ 22.50 -RRB- , was racism .
African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks .
Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line -LRB- performing of course for all-white audiences -RRB- .
`` She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her , '' sniffed the literary world 's Maria Jolas , not entirely inaccurately .
Ms. Rose , who teaches literature at Wesleyan University , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous .
It is easy to see why Baker , a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women , attracts Ms. Rose , the author of `` Parallel Lives , '' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage .
Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term .
Baker was 68 years old when she died in Paris , two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show : a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life .
During World War II , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by only about 2 % of French citizens .
In Humphrey Bogart 's nightclub , Victor Laszlo leads Free French sympathizers in `` La Marseillaise '' to drown out the Nazis .
The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` J'ai J'ai deux amours '' they wept .
In her introduction , Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker , but as `` Jazz Cleopatra '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested .
One chapter opens : `` World War II was not one of France 's glorious moments . ''
One devoted fan who fell under Baker 's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond .
The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read , but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why Ernest Hemingway called Baker `` The most sensational woman anybody ever saw .

Heady stuff it 's not .
The Denver-based concern , which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year , is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust .
When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash .
Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market .
If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail .
The trust is n't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its Manville stock .
Its cash and liquid securities fell by $ 338 million in the first six months of 1989 .
And , beginning in 1992 , it will have a claim on as much as 20 % of Manville 's annual net income .
As of June 30 , it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims , for an average of $ 40,424 each .
And as of midyear , settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ 136 million -- more than half the trust 's total of $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities .
Even before then , the trust may be eager to unload Manville stock .
Moreover , with 88 % of its assets tied up in Manville , the trust is badly in need of diversification .
Manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring .
We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says .
But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 .
Thus , analysts say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville 's other shareholders .
Even if there is no restructuring , Manville seems to be attractive long-term .
Mr. Bullock says 45 % of revenues are tied to construction .
They are , nonetheless , high on Manville 's management .
And he says Manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible other construction-related firms are hurting and selling cheap .
So far , as a price-conscious shopper , Manville has n't bought much .
And Mr. Kleinaitis says that with 80 % of its stock in friendly hands , Manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul .
Business : Forest products and roofing
Third quarter , Sept. 30 , 1989 : Per-share earnings : 30 cents vs. 44 cents
Common shares outstanding : 120 million
Year ago figure is restated .
Yesterday , in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange , Vermont American common closed at $ 39.75 , off 25 cents .
Spokesmen for Emerson and Vermont American , which has agreed to be acquired , said they do n't anticipate `` any problems '' with the completion of the transaction .
Emerson and Bosch , through their joint acquisition arm , Maple Acquisition , have begun a cash tender offer for all of Vermont 's common shares outstanding .
St. Louis-based Emerson and Stuttgart-based Bosch make electrical and electronic products , including power tools .
Santa Fe Pacific Corp. is preparing a plan to sell a 20 % stake in its large real estate unit to a California public employee pension fund for $ 400 million , after which it would spin off the realty operation to shareholders .
Santa Fe Pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today , according to people familiar with the transaction .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Santa Fe Pacific closed at $ 20.625 , down 25 cents .
A spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week 's Northern California earthquake .
A spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund .
The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell , the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock , have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments , including possible spinoffs .
The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations , as well as real estate .
At the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze .
Pension funds rarely own as much as a 20 % stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company .
But fund officials said the Santa Fe Pacific Realty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with California properties .
Under the proposed plan , the fund would also lend Santa Fe Pacific Realty $ 75 million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price .
The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments , Mr. Roulac said .
For the last year , Santa Fe Pacific has redirected its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties , hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio .
In a statement late yesterday , Santa Fe Pacific 's chairman , Robert D. Krebs , said that Santa Fe Pacific Realty would repay more than $ 500 million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff .
It was n't clear where Santa Fe Pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $ 500 million , which would be well above the $ 400 million that California pension fund officials say they plan to provide
The Santa Fe Pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect , saying the deal was still under negotiation .
It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential , but under a previously announced strategy , the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California , Arizona and the Chicago area .
The California pension fund , which has $ 16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages , could be a valuable funding source for that development , although it is n't obliged to make further investments .
Fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with Santa Fe Pacific , but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago .
GAF , Part III is scheduled to begin today .
The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government 's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations .
The government 's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness , Boyd L. Jefferies , the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky , and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin , takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian .
Mr. Jefferies 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing .
The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document .
Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June .
In August , Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts .
The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF , Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo .
GAF faces potential fines of $ 500,000 for each count .
There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF 's attorney , Arthur Liman , and Mr. Sherwin 's counsel , Stephen Kaufman , will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman .
For now , defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans .
DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal .
The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other .
The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims .
The latter provision is `` legally unprecedented , '' said Alan B. Morrison , a public interest lawyer in Washington , D.C. , who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants .
The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries .
American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted .
The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6 .
Charles A. Donohoo , sole proprieter of a Louisville , Ky. , demolition company , was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act .
Under Superfund , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time .
But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment .
Mr. Donohoo was convicted in Louisville late last month of violating Superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was demolishing .
The government sought a criminal penalty because `` no cleanup is possible here .
Mr. Donohoo is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 11 .
Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act .
Wilmer , Cutler & Pickering , the Washington , D.C. , law firm that spent over $ 1 million fighting the execution of mass-murderer Ted Bundy -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the Supreme Court , this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in Arkansas .
The key issue in the case , which the law firm is handling without a fee , or pro bono , is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review .
Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons 's death sentence in a `` next friend '' capacity .
P.J. Mode , Wilmer Cutler 's managing partner , says the trial team that represented Mr. Bundy was asked by the firm 's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised .
`` We give them a lot of credit for taking this case , '' says WLF 's Alan Slobodin .
James Burke and Larry Evans , formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery , and Prudence Clark , a Barclay sales representative , were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed , limited-edition lithographs .
Henry Pitman , the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case , said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that Barclay 's total proceeds from the sales were $ 3.4 million .
The posters were printed on paper pre-signed by Mr. Dali , the attorneys said .
The banking company could n't be reached to comment beyond a written announcement .
Westamerica said Mr. Decker 's posts were assumed by David Payne , Westamerica 's chairman , who at 34 years of age becomes one of the youngest chief executives of a sizable bank in the country .
Neither Mr. Payne nor Mr. Decker could be reached to comment .
It controls about 35 % of the affluent Marin County market across the Golden Gate bridge from San Francisco .
He was brought to the company in September 1988 after 15 years at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp .
When he was hired , Mr. Payne lauded Mr. Decker 's `` extraordinary... skills '' and his `` outstanding reputation as one of the West 's brightest bankers . ''
For the six months ended June 30 , it earned $ 3.1 million , or 61 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 2.4 million , or 41 cents a share , a year earlier .
Interstate banking is scheduled to begin in California in 1991 , and larger California banks , such as Wells Fargo & Co. , have been paying fat premiums to buy smaller banks to control markets before any out-of-state banks enter the fray .
Varian Associates Inc. , Palo Alto , Calif. , reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit plunged more than 95 % to $ 1 million , or five cents a share , from $ 24.2 million , or $ 1.10 a share , in the year-earlier quarter .
For the full fiscal year , Varian posted a 13 % profit rise to $ 31.5 million , or $ 1.53 a share , up from $ 27.8 million , or $ 1.27 a share , last year .
A profit last year in both the quarter and year included a net gain of $ 9.6 million , or 44 cents a share , from the sale of a division .
Shares of Varian , which last month warned there would be a fourth-quarter plunge , closed at $ 22.75 , down 62.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
In a last-ditch effort to keep its sales force and customer base , Integrated Resources Inc. said it agreed in principle to transfer ownership of its broker-dealer subsidiary to two of its top executives .
It said it will exercise that right only if it sells substantially all of its other core businesses .
Also , the broker-dealer subsidiary , Integrated Resources Equity Corp. , was renamed Royal Alliance Associates Inc .
Royal Alliance , to which the 3,900 representatives ' licenses will be transferred , is a shell company Integrated owns .
Integrated will pump $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million into Royal Alliance as initial funding .
If Integrated regains Royal Alliance , the representatives will retain their 49 % ownership .
The subsidiary is n't expected to be profitable for at least one year .
If the deal closes , the two officers will draw salaries from the independent operation , not from Integrated .
`` I think it was something that we and they thought was constructive , '' said Stephen D. Weinroth , chairman and co-chief executive officer of Integrated .
In New York Stock Exchange Composite trading , Integrated shares closed at $ 1.125 , up 12.5 cents .
The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since late August , prompting the Bank of Canada to sell the Canadian currency on the market .
They noted , however , that a 26-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave the dollar a sharp nudge downward late in the day .
Sterling was quoted at $ 1.6030 , up from $ 1.5885 late Friday .
The market 's attention is especially focused on a preliminary report on the U.S. third-quarter gross national product , due out Thursday , which could show the economy is continuing to expand at a relatively brisk pace .
Few market participants expect the U.S. unit to rally sharply on the news , if it turns out as expected .
`` Everyone is waiting for GNP , '' says Walter Simon , an assistant treasurer with Bank Julius Baer & Co .
Hubert Pedroli , managing director of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse in New York , adds , `` The market sees this as the last piece of good news . ''
Analysts predict a 3.5 % rise in the deflator , after climbing 4.6 % in the second quarter .
A 190-point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view , they say .
If we 're not headed for a recession , we 're certainly headed for a major slowdown . ''
U.S. durable goods orders are expected to show a decline of 1.2 % in September , according to economists .
Traders , however , are quick to point out that while there is little enthusiasm for buying dollars , the U.S. unit has found a `` natural bottom '' at about 1.85 marks and 140 yen .
On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery settled at $ 367 an ounce , down 30 cents .
In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday , gold was quoted at $ 366.79 an ounce .
The big apparel maker and retailer said that its net income in the latest quarter increased to $ 51.1 million , or 58 cents a share , from $ 31.7 million , or 36 cents a share , a year earlier .
Claiborne shares closed yesterday at $ 25.125 , up 50 cents , in national over-the-counter trading .
For the nine months , net income rose 48 % to $ 124.2 million , or $ 1.41 a share , from $ 83.8 million , or 96 cents a share a year earlier .
Tokyo stocks closed firmer Monday , with the Nikkei index making its fifth consecutive daily gain .

Exxon Corp. filed suit against the state of Alaska , charging state officials interfered with the oil company 's initial efforts to treat last spring 's giant oil spill .
The state 's suit alleges that Exxon 's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound .
Neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely because damage assessment has n't yet been completed .
Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years .
The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef .
Exxon has made them before , at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue .
Since the spill last March , Exxon and the state have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage .
The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard .
Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say Exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway .

The House Appropriations Committee approved an estimated $ 2.85 billion in emergency funding to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and to extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo .
By a 26-7 margin , the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative , and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten -LRB- D. , Miss . -RRB- and his party 's largest state delegation in the House .
`` We are the Golden State , '' Mr. Fazio said , `` and there is a certain amount of jealousy . ''
The funding is attached to a stopgap bill to keep most of the government operating through Nov. 15 .
Given California 's size and political importance , the White House is eager to appear generous .
A White House budget office analysis estimates that $ 500 million -- or half the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance to meet California 's needs , and the administration rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster loans by the Small Business Administration .
I would hope very much that we would n't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat . ''
A master of pork-barrel politics , he had crafted the $ 2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative .
On the chairman 's motion , the California package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language , and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote , Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it .
Mr. Whitten 's package appears to accomplish this purpose , but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in the next six months .
The California Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands , and lumber interests sought to add another $ 100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in North and South Carolina .

The company attributed the improvement to strong demand in the semiconductor equipment segment as well as the acquisition of Echelon Service Co. and the inclusion of a full year 's results of operations for RTS Inc. , compared with seven months ' results for the prior year .

Property Capital Trust said it dropped its plan to liquidate because it was n't able to realize the value it had expected .
Property Capital , which is based in Boston , had told shareholders it expected to distribute at least $ 21 a share , or $ 229 million , in a liquidation , based on an expected asset sale price of $ 290 million or more .
As a result of dropping the liquidation plan , shareholders will have to treat dividends received this year as ordinary income or capital gains rather than as tax free returns of capital , the company said .

The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants .
Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the official , David Runkel , said .
The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law .
The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers .
The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said .
In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .
Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez .
But instead of thanks , Sen. Cranston was treated with cool formality .
Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate , where California Sen. Cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor , Charles Keating Jr. , principal stockholder of Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. of Phoenix , Ariz .
Mr. Keating arranged nearly $ 1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes , and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers .
Unlike many lawmakers , Chairman Gonzalez says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper .
And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously .
Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues , even those of opposing political parties .
But Chairman Gonzalez is a genuine maverick .
Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open .
The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez 's inquiry is Danny Wall , chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision .
Rep. Gonzalez seems primed to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco , William Black and Mike Patriarca .
Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to Washington by Mr. Wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance .
Mr. Wall , however , is a self-proclaimed `` child of the Senate '' and former staff director of its Banking Committee .
They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years .
This is raising eyebrows .
There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators . ''
All the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent .
Chairman Gonzalez expresses sympathy for Sen. Riegle , his counterpart as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
But at the same time , Mr. Gonzalez has n't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. Wall during House-Senate negotiations over S* bailout legislation during the summer .
They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve Mr. Wall 's job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about Lincoln S&L .
At the time , Mr. Gonzalez said several senators told him that they `` could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn 's insistence on Wall . ''
`` In a way , that 's what this is , '' Mr. Gonzalez concedes .
Mr. Keating raised $ 20,000 for Rep. Doug Barnard 's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering .
But the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others .
A witness set to testify on Thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying Lincoln `` laundered '' campaign contributions illegally .
`` I do n't know whether it was done properly or not , because I 'm not a lawyer , '' he said in a telephone interview yesterday .
The committee also has summoned Mr. Wall 's predecessor , Edwin Gray .
So the senators must brace themselves .
When Anne Volokh and her family immigrated to the U.S. 14 years ago , they started life in Los Angeles with only $ 400 .
Not surprisingly , she quickly adapted to the American way .
-LRB- `` A `` A turban , '' she specifies , `` though it was n't the time for that 14 years ago .
Since then she has become wealthy .
Most recently , she has become the publisher of Movieline , a four-year-old Los Angeles magazine that began national distribution last month , with an initial press run of 100,000 copies .
It 's being sold through bookstores , newsstands and some video stores .
Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev , when she lived with her parents , her husband and her two sons in a 2 apartment in what she calls `` silent internal immigration , '' dreaming of escape .
However , she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel .
She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox .
`` No , darling , '' she said recently in her fluent , slightly affected English , during a trip East to promote Movieline 's national expansion .
I used to wear hats in Russia , but I had to make them and my dresses .
Now 48 years old , Ms. Volokh has definite ideas about what she wants .
In restaurants -LRB- in this case , the Russian Samovar , a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres -RRB- , she did n't want the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room .
That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties .
If you are born to give parties , you give parties .
In Los Angeles , in our lean years , we gave parties . ''
She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people , but prefers more intimate gatherings .
I like rather tea , because it is at the end of the day . ''
It 's supposed to be later but I just moved it .
She also frequently invites directors , producers , actors , writers and other show business people for `` coffee and clips in the pleasure dome . ''
They eat `` sinful and sensual things '' -- and explain their clips .
The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs , Boris Krutchensky -LRB- who has the title of co-publisher -RRB- , and Laurie Halpern Smith , now the magazine 's co-editor .
She was interested only if she could guide it editorially as well .
She wants things to be exciting .
She 'll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible , then she 'll have us make it work . ''
Back in the Soviet Union she was a respected journalist , writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday Izvestia .
`` I do n't trust people who do n't eat , '' said Ms. Volokh , though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds .
No one ever eats in their books and look at them .
In her cookbook , which Macmillan is bringing out in soft cover this month -LRB- with the blini recipe revised so it works -RRB- , she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature : Pushkin on blini , Goncharov on piroghi .
In a great restaurant , do n't deprive yourself .
Amusing as she is , and frivolous as she can seem , this is a serious person with some difficult memories .
Her mother was a translator ; her father was `` the eternal vice director . ''
But we should n't leave out political reasons , number one .
One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . ''
The wait was miserable .
Mr. Volokh was fired from his job , and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities .
They did n't .
Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field , but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available a Russian who spoke fluent English .
I wanted to be in business . ''
Soon she was running the office .
Now Movieline is located in the same building as Vesoft .
You never know if you 'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one .
William D. Forrester , president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council , has a warning for U.S. companies trying to do business in the Soviet Union .
We are not trying to encourage everyone . ''
Doing business with the Russians , once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans , has become the goal of such major companies as General Motors Corp. , Federal Express Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. , as well as a cluster of smaller firms .
But while U.S. interest may be big and growing , the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating .
Executives say Mr. Gorbachev 's moves to break up the government 's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities .
And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics .
As part of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying .
Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p . A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .
Whatever the difficulties , Mr. Gorbachev remains committed to increasing foreign trade .
Talking to a small group of U.S. executives afterwards , Mr. Gorbachev appeared impatient for a big expansion in U.S.-Soviet trade , which now amounts to a meager $ 3 billion annually .
According to several people present at the meeting , Mr. Gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the U.S. , possibly at his next summit meeting with President Bush .
Hundreds of people lined up every day at the Colgate-Palmolive Co. stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste , a commodity in chronically short supply here .
Some U.S. products are filtering into the Soviet market under an emergency import program .
The American Trade Consortium says it is planning to ship some $ 500 million of consumer goods , financed by bank credits , in the first few months of next year .
The goal of most U.S. firms -- joint ventures -- remains elusive .
International competition for the few Soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up , however .
Seeking to overcome the currency problems , Mr. Giffen 's American Trade Consortium , which comprises Chevron Corp. , RJR , Johnson & Johnson , Eastman Kodak Co. , and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings , largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project .
`` It 's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries , '' says Dennis A. Sokol , president of Medical Service Partners Inc. , who is putting the medical consortium together .
One group seeks to publish a U.S.-Soviet medical journal in conjunction with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health .
It will be financed by advertisements from U.S. companies and by simultaneous publication of an English-language journal containing details of Soviet medical advancements .
It 's truly entrepreneurial .

Shareholders of Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano S.p . A. voted to accept a bid of 5,500 lire -LRB- $ 4.03 -RRB- a share by France 's Credit Agricole for 13.32 % of the bank , rejecting an earlier , equal offer by Italy 's Assicurazioni Generali S.p . A .
It also opens a rift in the bank 's shareholders ' syndicate that could lead to a battle for control of the concern .
Credit Agricole asked a Milan court to sequester the Nuovo Banco shares , the Italian news agency ANSA reported .
No reason for the request was given .
The decision to accept Credit Agricole 's bid , valued at 283.3 billion lire -LRB- $ 207.4 million -RRB- , came after a stormy weekend meeting .
Gemina , which owns 13.26 % of Nuovo Banco , abstained in the final vote on Credit Agricole , which was nonetheless approved by a majority of shareholders .
Since then , the bank has strengthened its Italian network , and has posted strong results .
Gemina said in a statement that `` it reserves the right to take any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate . ''
Generali , Italy 's biggest insurer , last month offered 5,500 lire a share for the Nuovo Banco stake held by Banco Popolare di Milano , the bank 's largest shareholder , which announced plans to sell the holdings earlier this year .
On the Milan stock exchange , Nuovo Banco 's shares jumped to 4,830 lire each from 4,695 lire Friday .
Mr. Skase , a 41-year-old former newspaper reporter who chairs the company , said in a statement that Qintex will sell its 51 % stake in its upscale Mirage resorts in Australia and Hawaii as well as three Australian television stations .
Qintex Australia has n't disclosed its borrowings , but analysts estimate the company 's debt at A$ 1.2 billion .
He said the move will `` significantly reduce administrative and operating costs , '' but he did n't provide details of the merger .
Friday , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a 43%-owned U.S. affiliate , filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code .
The company 's latest moves were disclosed after the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of Qintex Australia and Qintex Ltd. because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans , investments and deposits at Qintex Entertainment .
It said Qintex Entertainment owes Qintex Australia US$ 38.1 million in loans not secured by specific assets .
In the statement , Mr. Skase said that on the basis of current interest rates in Australia , the company 's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about A$ 120 million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities .
Yesterday 's statement did n't say whether the Japanese companies will acquire Qintex 's remaining stake in the resorts .
The shares traded at about A$ 1.50 in March , when the plan to acquire was announced .
Mr. Skase 's statement cited four recent problems that he said had cut group cash flow by more than A$ 200 million .
has sued Qintex Australia for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement , and Qintex Australia has threatened a countersuit .
In his statement , Mr. Skase said preliminary accounts showed that group profit before interest , tax and depreciation `` will exceed A$ 170 million . ''
Shareholders ' funds as of July 31 were estimated at more than A$ 1 billion , Mr. Skase said , compared with A$ 725 million a year earlier .
Mr. Skase also disclosed a disagreement among directors of Qintex Australia over certain fees claimed by Qintex Group Management Services Pty. , a management-services concern in which Qintex Australia executives have an interest .
Mr. Skase said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel , but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services .
Two of the directors resigned , Mr. Skase said , so the payments have n't yet been approved .
TWO COMPANIES plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off .
National Semiconductor Corp. and a start-up named Ramtron Corp. plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories , which can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to them .
Developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology is n't fully refined .
The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment , including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives .
National says it agreed to acquire Krysalis 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips , including a 4-kilobit memory , next year .
In addition to not needing an outside power source , they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips .
And while today 's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they `` learn '' data slowly , ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds .
AN AUSTIN , Texas , company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town .
That means huge travel bills .
That could change , thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics .
The company installed a prototype system that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines .
While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper .
Japanese Reverse Tack On Patent Protection
Now at least one Japanese company is turning the courtroom tables .
But last year Hitachi Ltd. surprised Japan 's electronics industry when it accused Korea 's Samsung Electronics Co. of using Hitachi technology to make dynamic random-access memory chips .
And Hitachi went on the offensive against the U.S. 's Motorola Inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that Motorola 's new MC88200 chip infringes on a Hitachi patent .
The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say Japan is starting to take .
Hitachi charges Motorola `` has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain Motorola patents '' used in Motorola 's MC68030 microprocessor chip .
Motorola either denied or would n't comment on the various charges .
COMPUTER chips that simulate human vision have been developed by Japan 's Sharp Corp .
Sharp says the set of chips could improve fax machines , graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features .
Using reduced instruction-set computing , or RISC , chips made by Intergraph of Huntsville , Ala. , the system splits the image it `` sees '' into 20 digital representations , each processed by one chip .
The results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders .
Net for the quarter was $ 62.8 million , or 73 cents a share , down from $ 64.9 million , or 72 cents a share , a year earlier .
Tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30 , down from 90 million a year earlier .
Tandy said consumer electronics sales at its Radio Shack stores have been slow , partly because of a lack of hot , new products .
He said Tandy `` has done a decent job '' increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary , which sells computers to bigger businesses , but `` it 's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack . ''
As a result , Mr. Telzrow said he cut his fiscal 1990 per-share earnings estimate for Tandy to $ 4.05 from $ 4.20 .
Barry Bryant , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , said Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market .
Mr. Bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help Tandy 's results improve in the important Christmas quarter .
If the earnings acceleration is to take place , that should be the quarter .
Mr. Joseph conceded the junk market was in disarray , according to people familiar with the discussion .
The dinner was a stark confirmation that 1989 is the worst year ever for the $ 200 billion junk market .
Amid the market disorder , even Drexel , which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors , is pulling in its horns .
For many money managers , the past four months have been humiliating .
In the third quarter , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so .
The junk market , which mushroomed to $ 200 billion from less than $ 2 billion at the start of the decade , has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments .
Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale .
In an interview , Mr. Joseph says his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk .
Nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years , and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market . ''
Unlike the New York Stock Exchange , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs .
In recent months , they say , there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors , while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them .
Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said .
And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation .
Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality .
`` We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here , and it 's something to be concerned about , '' says James A. Gregoire , a managing director .
This market teaches us to be humble . ''
Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default , the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble , says Stuart Reese , manager of Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's $ 17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio .
And the risks are n't appropriate for us , '' he says .
The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say .
Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings .
One indication of a growing number of junk defaults , Mr. Asquith says , is that about half of the $ 3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S&P this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of 1984 through 1986 .
`` Obviously , we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky , '' says Bradford Cornell , professor of finance at University of California 's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles .
Mr. Cornell says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel claimed , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . ''
During the past three weeks , for example , Drexel has sold $ 1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co. , Uniroyal Chemical , Continental Air and Duff & Phelps .
Troubled Drexel-underwritten issues include Resorts International , Braniff , Integrated Resources , SCI TV , Gillette Holdings , Western Electric and Southmark .
`` But the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste .
Then , flashing a diamond ring as big as the Ritz -LRB- `` my day diamond , darling '' -RRB- , she told her two companions that she is on the `` board '' of the Vatican Museum in Rome .
But Mrs. Boehm did n't mention any of them .
Like which are droppable and which are not .
But the truth is that almost everyone , from real-estate agents to city fathers , name-drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the Katzenjammer Kids .
`` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high-powered clientele .
It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know . ''
I was having a drink in Sardi 's , when all of a sudden I saw a woman 's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks .
So I said , ` Hello . '
Can you imagine ?
Some people must drop names -- call it an irresistible impulse .
Beauregard Houston-Montgomery , a New York writer who changed his name from William Stretch in 1980 , is an inveterate name-dropper .
Name-dropping recently helped Mr. Houston-Montgomery crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol .
After all , Warhol was the ultimate namedropper , dropping five a day in his diaries .
Mr. Houston-Montgomery says that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes , publisher of Forbes magazine -LRB- `` We've been in the columns together '' -RRB- , Mary Boone , a New York art dealer -LRB- `` I `` I think she knows me , but I 'm not sure `` -RRB- and Bridget Fonda , the actress -LRB- `` She knows me , but we 're not really the best of friends '' -RRB- .
These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps , Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher .
It 's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts . ''
In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer .
It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock'n ' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant .
`` It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths .
`` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. Miller says .
`` Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in Van Nuys and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original Lone Ranger lived there , '' says David Rambo , a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co. , a Los Angeles real-estate agency .
It is John Hart . -RRB-
`` If Flynn had n't lived there , the property might have been priced $ 1 million lower , '' says Mr. Rambo , noting that Flynn 's house has been bulldozed , and only the swimming pool remains .
And some even do it with malice aforethought .
He says that when Dan Dorfman , a financial columnist with USA Today , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman 's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump , Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis .
`` But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , '' Mr. Kessler says .
Jeffry Thal , a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud .
Mr. Thal says that Elizabeth Taylor , a client , `` hates being called ` Liz . '
She prefers ` Elizabeth . ' ''
And her husband sometimes calls her `` Ducky . ''
John Spencer Churchill , a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill , former prime minister of Great Britain , is n't that impressed with most name-droppers he meets .
Currently writing his memoirs , Mr. Churchill , an artist , tells how tycoons such as the late Jean Paul Getty , the oil billionnaire , were , in fact , known only by one initial , their last .
Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean .
Now that 's name-dropping , if you know what I mean .
SMYRNA , Ga. -- The auto-dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along Cobb Parkway , stretching from the Perimeter highway that circles Atlanta to the `` Big Chicken , '' a pullet-roofed fast-food restaurant and local landmark .
Now there are 23 .
Under construction is the strip 's 24th showroom , the future home of Lexus , a luxury marque launched by Toyota Motor Corp. just two months ago .
And especially , as the Cobb Parkway strip attests , in cars .
For car marketers , it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block .
Malcolm MacDougall , vice chairman of the Jordan , McGrath , Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York , calls the proliferation `` nameplate mania . ''
`` The winners , '' he predicts , `` will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value . ''
He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines .
`` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp .
Jeanene Page , of North Salt Lake City , Utah , likes the broader selection .
Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time .
Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago .
Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose .
Today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans .
For every brand like Renault or Fiat that has been squeezed out , others such as Isuzu , Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in .
GM launched the Geo marque this year to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers , and next year GM 's long-awaited Saturn cars will make their debut .
But slow sales forced Ford to kill the brand just last week .
The Wall Street Journal 's `` American Way of Buying '' survey found that 53 % of today 's car buyers tend to switch brands .
Which cars do Americans favor most these days ?
Adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury cars , convertibles and imports far more than their elders do .
Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37 % to 28 % margin -- even though older buyers , because of their incomes , are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car .
That 's true of only 14 % of households headed by someone 60 or older .
`` For many baby boomers , buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience , '' says Christopher Cedergren , auto-market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills , Calif .
Only 58 % of Americans now believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models , the Journal survey found , down from 68 % in 1987 .
On the other hand , only 42 % say foreign cars are less comfortable than U.S. models , down from 55 % in 1987 .
`` Once buying habits are formed , they 're very hard to break , '' declares Thomas Mignanelli , executive vice president for Nissan 's U.S. sales operations .
`` The competition is so intense that an owner 's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent , '' says Mr. Negas , vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile , one of the first dealerships to locate on the strip .
The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the Cobb Parkway strip .
Just down the street , Chris Volvo invites serious shoppers to test-drive a new Volvo to any other dealership along the strip , and compare the cars side-by-side .
GM 's Cadillac division , ignoring Detroit 's long-held maxim that safety does n't sell , is airing television commercials touting its cars ' safety features .
Some 60 % of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag .
Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 .
But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days .
The reason : Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today 's .
`` Even if it 's only 1 % , '' says GM 's Mr. Barabba , `` would you throw away sales the size of Polaroid ? ''
The workers install , maintain and repair its private branch exchanges , which are large intracompany telephone networks .
Edward Carlson awoke one morning last month to find eight holes in his front yard where his prized miniature palms , called cycads , once stood .
`` The second time , '' he says , `` they left the shovel . ''
Cycads , the most popular of which is the Sago Palm , are doll-sized versions of California 's famous long-necked palms , with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds .
`` Evidently , somebody has realized it 's easy money to steal these things , '' says Loran Whitelock , a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum .
`` It 's hard to think someone is raping your garden , '' he says .
The Sago has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts , apparently giving the rustlers a ready market for their filched fronds .
The department is advising residents to plant Sagos , if they must , in the back yard and telling nurseries to be on the lookout for anyone trying to palm one off .
After three Sagos were stolen from his home in Garden Grove , `` I put a big iron stake in the ground and tied the tree to the stake with a chain , '' he says proudly .
Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume .
A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September , the second-highest level ever .
Average daily trading volume in June of 180.3 million shares was considerably higher than in September .
The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks .
It 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market .
Overall , Salomon reported program trading volume of 75.2 million shares .
Of Morgan Stanley 's 66.8 million shares in program trades for the month , 53.1 million were in stock-index arbitrage trades .
A group of shareholders filed suit against Imperial Corp. of America , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , First Executive Corp. and others , charging them with artificially inflating Imperial 's stock price to protect certain major investors .
It also charges that Imperial , the holding company for Imperial Savings & Loan , experienced major losses and writedowns because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages .
Imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities .
Imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in Barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems .
Spokesmen at Drexel and First Executive said the companies had n't yet been served with the suit .
Imperial said it had n't been served with this suit either .
The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .
Rhone-Poulenc S.A. , Paris , said it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of RTZ Corp. , a British mining and industrial group .
It did n't release terms of the transaction .
A group including Gene E. Phillips , former chairman of Southmark Corp. , and William S. Friedman , former vice chairman of Southmark , lowered its stake in the Dallas real estate concern to 7.7 % , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The filing said the group continues to hold 3,481,887 remaining shares .
The move also helps the Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly , supplying every Hollywood movie company -- is n't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business .
`` The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along , '' says David Niles , president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc. , a New York pioneer in high-definition programming .
Japanese electronic giants , such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. , have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware , and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition .
It 's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing .
Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers .
It would be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color TV set , '' says Malcolm G. Saull , chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
Kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market , but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years .
And the potential market is tremendous , industry experts say .
Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations .
And Mr. Niles , the program producer , contends that Kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision .
Indeed , the stakes are high .
HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines , compared with 525 for today 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail .
But the financial rewards are n't expected soon , nor are they guaranteed .
Some critics say they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price .
`` Kodak understands HDTV is where everybody is going , '' says RIT 's Mr. Spaull .
But this time it 's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members .
Already , ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month .
`` The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast , '' says Shigezo Hayasaka , former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst .
This time , the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry .
The donations so far appear to be small , especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co . influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year .
Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders .
Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan .
Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
At 500 yen -LRB- $ 3.60 -RRB- for a handful of balls , pachinko is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II .
And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion , some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen .
In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions .
The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral .
The magazine alleged that in making the donations , the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards , or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents ' organization , the Chosen Soren .
And at first , neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue .
Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations .
Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members .
On Friday , the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry , including 450,000 yen -LRB- $ 3,175 -RRB- by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu .
Direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign , but both groups deny making direct donations .
The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents , those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese .
Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians , the way many Japanese do , to win favor or support .
But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP 's alleged donations , implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally .
Unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night , and she was adamant about his attending .
But once Perlman started playing , I did n't give a damn about basketball .
Today , it 's obvious that the brawny , six-foot , one-inch musician made the right choice .
He 's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia , with stops including Charleston , S.C . -LRB- Oct. 25 -RRB- , Sarasota , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 28 -RRB- , Tampa , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 29 -RRB- and Miami -LRB- Oct. 31 -RRB- .
Yet Mr. McDuffie 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries .
His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz , a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; Cho-Liang Lin , who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18 ; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg , who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition .
But I was n't ready for a career at that time . ''
`` He taught me how to play like a gypsy , '' jokes the musician .
After studies at that conservatory 's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian , he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay , Mr. Galamian 's longtime assistant and , ultimately , his rival .
But she was always encouraging .
In my freshman year , my roommate was known as a party animal .
As the violinist tells it , his grandmotherly looking teacher `` put her hands on her hips , stomped her foot and said , ` You 've just got to get the -LCB- expletive deleted -RCB- out of there . ' ''
Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital .
That 's the only note that 's truly in tune . . . ' . ''
Now , when I play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation . ''
After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's `` Violin Concerto , '' Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer , who was dying of cancer .
He did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score .
The only time the violin has it is right at the end .
And he yelled out ` dolce dolce ' -LCB- ` sweet sweet ' -RCB- . ''
I played very transparently , with the tip of the bow .
I do n't know why Barber never told anybody else .
Since leaving Juilliard , Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones .
By contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which he recently recorded for along with Leonard Bernstein 's engaging `` Serenade for Violin Solo , Strings and Percussion . ''
Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin 's direction , this `` Serenade '' really swings .
But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist , brass and timpani .
His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed .
Whatever he plays , Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself -- `` something greater out there than me , '' as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment he shares with wife , Camille , a literary publicist .
Even when I hear it played badly , I 'm still humbled by the piece .
Ms. Jepson is a free-lance music writer in New York .
A lot of observers think so , and , if they 're right , the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt .
And another wave of bad loans would further batter many already-shaky lending institutions .
During the almost seven-year-old economic expansion , inflation-adjusted gross national product , disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30 % , but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66 % .
However , these figures do n't seem to worry Thomas A. Durkin , an economist at the Federal Reserve Board .
He adds : `` We are now witnessing a slowdown which , if history is a guide , could persist for a while . ''
Mr. Durkin doubts that `` there is some magic level '' at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income `` indicates economic problems . ''
The chart below shows why -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 -RRB- .
Moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier , '' Mr. Durkin says .
In addition , he says , `` longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden . ''
Citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` 11 % of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to 16 % of homeowners in the $ 45,000-$60,000 income range and 23 % of homeowners with income above $ 60,000 . ''
`` The most frequent use is home improvement , which presumably improves the value of the property , '' Mr. Durkin says .
A severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat .
In July , consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987 .
As a result , household debt appears to be stabilizing at around 63 % of GNP . ''
Maidenform Inc. loves to be intimate with its customers , but not with the rest of the public .
`` There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group , '' says Robert A. Brawer , 52 years old , recently named president , succeeding Beatrice Coleman , his mother-in-law , who remains chairman .
Mrs. Coleman , 73 , who declined to be interviewed , is the Maidenform strategist .
Maidenform says it is very profitable but declines to provide specifics .
Its current ad campaign , on which Maidenform has spent more than $ 15 million since fall 1987 , does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like Christopher Reeve , star of the `` Superman '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn-ons .
Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I... in my Maidenform bra , '' and `` The Maidenform woman . You never know where she 'll turn up . ''
`` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly -LCB- Maidenform -RCB- is a force to be reckoned with , '' says David S. Leibowitz , a special situations analyst at American Securities Corp. in New York .
Although Mr. Brawer 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising .
Warnaco also owns Warners , another major intimate apparel maker .
But Maidenform officials say that after spending 24 years at Maidenform , Mr. Lesk , 48 , made it clear he wanted the top job .
The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people .
Top officers insist Maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership .
`` It is fun competing as a private company , '' Mr. Brawer says .
Other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way .
And last year , Playtex Holdings Inc. went private for about $ 680 million .
Publicly traded VF Corp. , which owns Vanity Fair , and Sara Lee Corp. , which owns Bali Co. , are also strong forces in intimate apparel .
When he gets calls , `` I do n't even have to consult '' with Mrs. Coleman , Mr. Masket says .
`` Over the past three and a half years , apparel companies , many of whom have strong brand names , have been bought at about 60 % of sales , '' says Deborah Bronston , Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. apparel analyst .
Mr. Brawer 's wife , Catherine , and Robert Stroup , Elizabeth 's husband , round out the five-member board .
`` We are all very amiable , '' Mr. Brawer says .
In the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales .
While Mr. Rosenthal introduced new undergarment designs , his wife , Ida , concentrated on sales and other financial matters .
The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the U.S. , Puerto Rico , other parts of the Caribbean and Ireland .
Before joining Maidenform in 1972 , Mr. Brawer , who holds a doctoral degree in English from the University of Chicago , taught at the University of Wisconsin .
To maintain exclusivity of that designer line , it is n't labeled with the Maidenform name .
Mrs. Coleman 's husband , Joseph , a physician , succeeded Mrs. Rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in 1968 .
According to the report , completed last month , if China 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year , the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991 .
The $ 14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much .
According to Chinese customs figures , import growth has slowed in recent months , dropping to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August from the year-earlier periods , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half .
The $ 14 billion level in June marked a drop from $ 19 billion at the end of April .
China might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the 1985 decline , when Beijing slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending and devalued the currency .
For example , China 's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4 .
Because of this and the huge trade gap , the deficit in China 's current account , which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds , is expected to widen sharply from the $ 3.8 billion deficit last year .
In one , imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25 % and 5 % recorded during the first seven months , and the current-account deficit widens to $ 13.1 billion .
The other scenario assumes that Beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months .
If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders , it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current-account deficit .
Even if borrowing resumes , commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before .
On top of all this , foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992 .
The Western government report 's first scenario assumes a 30 % reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5 % contraction in foreign direct investment .
But in either case , the report says , China 's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves , which are used to finance the imbalance .
Roche Holding AG , parent of the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group , said its group sales rose 22 % in the first nine months of the year to 7.32 billion francs -LRB- $ 4.51 billion -RRB- .
Roche also said it expects a `` considerable rise '' in 1989 group profit from the 641.5 million-franc -LRB- $ 396 million -RRB- net in 1988 .

New Canaan Investments is a closely held investment partnership with interests primarily in the packaging industry .
At 18,000 feet , he says , he and his co-pilot `` were looking for an interstate or a cornfield '' to land .
But knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs , Mr. Brown skipped his stop in nearby Chicago and set course to get his load -- a few hundred parcels -- to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time .
But he flies for Federal Express Corp. , perhaps the closest thing in corporate America to the Green Berets .
Like Mr. Brown , they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal : delivering the goods on time .
That may soon change .
The election , which would bring the first major union to Federal 's U.S. operations , has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as Mr. Brown .
`` A union , sooner or later , has to have an adversary , and it has to have a victory , '' Frederick W. Smith , Federal 's chairman and chief executive , says with disdain .
What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots .
Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers .
`` Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company , '' says Bernard La Londe , a professor at Ohio State University at Columbus and a Federal consultant .
Since founding the company , the charismatic Vietnam vet , who is still only 46 years old , has fostered an ethos of combat .
Mr. Smith 's managers have , at times , been called `` Ho Chi Minh 's Guerrillas . ''
Competitors are known as the `` enemy . ''
He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and , as a perk , fly free in empty cockpit seats .
And , with many of his 70,000 workers , Mr. Smith 's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on .
We do n't just hand the customer the package .
In essence , we run the show . ''
`` This is America , '' he says .
Such attitudes have given Federal flexibility , not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean .
But though couriers work as many as 60 hours a week during the autumn rush , they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck .
The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc. , the nation 's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members .
Because UPS drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot , say these couriers , packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late .
Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be , it also has brought problems .
Federal , on its own , had n't been doing very well overseas .
On routes to South America , the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were grounded .
These and other problems squeezed Federal 's profit margins last year to 8 % , down from more than 13 % annually in the first half of the decade .
In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31 , profit fell 54 % to $ 30.4 million , or 58 cents a share , mostly because of the Tiger merger , Federal says .
Since trading as low as $ 42.25 a share in May , Federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ 57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
There 's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase .
In the early 1970s , Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger 's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations .
Federal Express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually .
Until then , they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits .
Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers insubordination .
He then made most of the changes , pilots say .
Its 6,500 workers , who had battled Tiger 's management for years over givebacks , were union members until the day of the merger , when most of their unions were automatically decertified .
When the pilots refused , the company retracted it .
In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August , Mr. Smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago : that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be `` end-tailed '' -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules , pay and career options .
Mr. Smith is trying hard to allay the anger .
`` A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith , '' says J.X. Gollich , a Tiger-turned-Federal pilot and union activist .
Recently , they have appeared every few weeks in talk-show type videos , countering pro-union arguments .
He said Mr. Steinberg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly .
Furthermore , Mr. Smith added , `` our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice .
Already , the fight has been costly .
Meanwhile , the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists , and that is costing Federal `` a big number , '' says James Barksdale , executive vice president and chief operating officer .
`` They were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie , any resistance , '' says William Queenan , a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran .
Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote .
But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed , it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded .
Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties .
And for now , at least , the competition is n't the only enemy .
`` The pilots are either for us or extremely against us , '' he says with a sigh .
Harsco declined to say what country placed the order .
Delivery is to begin in early 1991 .
The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles , removing the 53-year-old judge from his $ 89,500-a-year , lifetime job .
In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him .
With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed .
He was found not guilty of three charges , involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation .
Although Mr. Hastings had been acquitted by a jury , lawmakers handling the prosecution in Congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual .
Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll-call votes , then quickly left the chamber .
`` Their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers ' teaching regarding impeachment , '' Mr. Hastings said .
Mr. Hastings was appointed to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country .
Following the impeachment conviction , Dr. Benjamin Hooks , executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , issued a restrained statement , warning that the Hastings case could set a `` dangerous precedent , '' but adding , `` We must respect the considered judgment of the Senate .
What next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold ?
There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup : a nun raising some lovable orphans .
A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards .
Week by week on `` Mancuso FBI '' -LRB- NBC , Fridays , 10 p.m . ET -RRB- , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI .
The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing -LRB- a la John Tower -RRB- .
Last week , a young black girl claimed she had been raped by a white police officer -LRB- a la Tawana Brawley -RRB- .
Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting cast : a blond bombshell secretary -LRB- Randi Brazen -- her real name , honest -RRB- , a scheming young boss -LRB- Fredric Lehne -RRB- , another blonde bombshell who 's also an idealistic lawyer -LRB- Lindsay Frost -RRB- , and a forensics expert -LRB- Charles Siebert -RRB- .
In last week 's rape case , for example , the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest , and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case . -RRB-
What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s .
This is not the `` Mississippi Burning '' scenario that thrills his young colleagues : `` Kid , you 've been reading Classic Comics too long , '' Mancuso says .
Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover , and two cleaned his house . ''
He describes a reporter as `` Miss First Amendment . ''
And when he 's told `` Try a little tenderness , '' he shoots back `` I 'm going home to try a little linguine . ''
He 's the kind of guy who rescues trampled flags .
Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner -LRB- and Ken Solarz and Steve Bello -RRB- have revved this show up to the breaking point .
At least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans .
One more word and you are out on a park bench , mister . ''
In fact , throughout `` Mancuso FBI , '' we do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches .
And Mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs : `` How the hell can you live with yourself ? '' he erupts at a politician .
You built your career on prejudice and hate .
In each show , Mancuso gets to unleash similar harangues : `` Where the hell are they gon na live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump ?
And , at least once a show , someone delivers the line `` Get off that soapbox . ''
They have a series with a good character , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they 're ruining it .
It 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizzazz to a script that 's already overdosing on pizzazz .
That 's not character .
There is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where Mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner David .
He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away .
There 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of `` Mancuso FBI . ''
With a Twist of the Wrist Boys with tops , and Frisbee tossers , And P.R. types with bees in their bonnet , Have a goal in common , all of them try To put the right spin on it .

Texaco Inc. has purchased an oil-producing company in Texas for $ 476.5 million , its first major acquisition since its legal brawl with Pennzoil Co. began more than four years ago .
Tana , which holds properties in 17 oil and gas fields in south Texas , will provide Texaco with mostly gas reserves .
`` This acquisition is another indication of Texaco 's commitment to increase the company 's reserve base , '' said Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear .
At least two years ago , the company put 60 million barrels of oil reserves on the block .
Not all of those parcels have yet been sold .
Texaco , like many other oil companies , has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves .
Pennzoil had sued Texaco for improperly interfering with its acquisition of a portion of Getty Oil Co .
Mr. Icahn , who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company , sold his stake in Texaco just last summer .
CRI Inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its Capital Housing and Mortgage Partners Inc. trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share , from between 75 cents and 80 cents , for the year ending June 9 , 1990 .
CRI , which sponsors Champs , is a world-wide real estate investment firm .
The figure was incorrectly shown as a net loss in a chart accompanying Friday 's Heard on the Street column .
Actually , Cervantes borrowed that quote from a writer of some 25 centuries earlier : Israel 's King Solomon wrote those words in the Book of Proverbs -LRB- 22:1 -RRB- .
Japan had an unadjusted trade surplus of $ 1.82 billion for the first 10 days of October , down from $ 3.16 billion a year earlier , the Finance Ministry said .
The report follows five-consecutive declines in full monthly figures .
Exports during the period were $ 7.01 billion , 2.6 % below $ 7.20 billion a year ago .
Amid heavy buying of shares in Belgium 's largest insurer , Maurice Lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight , in buying out a raider , could leave speculators with big losses on their AG stock .
The most likely white knight would be Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. , which already owns 18 % of AG and which itself is controlled by Cie . Financiere de Suez , the acquisitive French financial conglomerate .
AG is hardly alone in its anxiety .
Worried by European Community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars .
In France , Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire , the sixth-largest European insurance company , after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle .
But he estimated that a raider would have been able to amass no more than 4 % of the shares in recent months .
They have all `` very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of AG , '' he said .
A `` syndicate '' of shareholders holds just under 50 % of AG , Mr. Lippens said , and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any AG shares .
A Generale spokesman confirmed that the giant Belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in AG should a raider seek control .
Even without bid talk , this year 's surge in prices for Brussels real estate has excited interest in AG .
With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama , one of the many lingering questions the Bush administration will ponder is this : Is the National Security Council staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to do its job of coordinating foreign policy ?
Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission , which investigated the Iran-Contra affair .
So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out .
However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues .
`` It 's a very small shop . ''
The NSC staff `` does n't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process , '' says Frank Gaffney , a former Pentagon aide who now runs the Center for Security Policy , a conservative Washington think-tank .
The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence agencies .
In practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members .
That task is one of Washington 's perennial problems .

Vickers PLC , a United Kingdom defense and engineering company , said an investment unit controlled by New Zealand financier Ron Brierley raised its stake in the company Friday to 15.02 % from about 14.6 % Thursday and from 13.7 % the previous week .
I.E.P. Securities Ltd. , a unit of Mr. Brierley 's Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity -LRB- Pacific -RRB- Ltd. , boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares .
The latest purchase follows small increases in his holdings made over the past five months .
In May , Mr. Brierley 's stake shrank to 8.7 % after ranging between 9 % and 11 % for much of the previous year .
`` Ron Brierley clearly views our company as a good investment , '' a Vickers spokesman said .
The spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Industrial Equity might use its interest as a platform to launch a hostile bid for the company .
Vickers makes tanks for the U.K. army , Rolls Royce cars , and has marine and medical businesses .
When Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants .
`` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls .
Yet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
It was a gutsy move for a little-known executive , fired after only two months as president of his previous company .
But going against the grain has never bothered Mr. Andersson .
Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview , the diminutive Swede quips : `` It turned out to be lucky for us .
If the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition . ''
Mr. Andersson is anxious to strengthen Trelleborg 's balance sheet .
Characteristically , he did n't waste much time getting started .
On Tuesday , Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange .
At current market prices , the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor -LRB- $ 386 million -RRB- to Trelleborg 's coffers , analysts say .
The board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares .
But that share issue -- intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , people familiar with the situation say .
Trelleborg 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged SKr29 -LRB- $ 4.48 -RRB- to SKr205 -LRB- $ 31.65 -RRB- in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm .
Tuesday , the shares regained SKr20 , closing at SKr225 .
Mr. Andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the `` conglomerate stigma '' that has held down Trelleborg 's share price .
Trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units .
The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent .
A family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59 % of Trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding .
But the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 % .
That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding .
That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson 's shopping spree , during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years .
Most of the new additions were barely profitable , if not outright loss makers .
Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux , Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results .
The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns .
Between 1985 and 1988 , sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold .
Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson , who owns 1.7 % of the company , to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year .
But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson describes as `` being the driving force leading the troops , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas . ''
Last month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd .
Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern .
`` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' says Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London .
`` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . ''
But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles .
Mr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division `` will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . ''
Booming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg 's recent profit surge , raising mining 's share of pretax profit to 68 % this year from a big loss two years earlier .
But analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth .
Mining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business .
Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture .
Noranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid .
Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge , and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf .
Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up .
Falconbridge , he says , will continue operating in its current form .
`` We 'd be reluctant to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company .
But such partnerships are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' Trelleborg 's president says .
Perhaps more important , both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries .
`` If the 1980s were a decade of consumption , the '90s will be the investment decade , '' Mr. Andersson says .
`` The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , '' he says .
`` That 's beginning to change .
And investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses Trelleborg is in .
Apple Computer Inc. posted improved fiscal fourth-quarter profit due largely to a $ 48 million gain on the sale of its stock in Adobe Systems Inc .
Excluding the gain , the company registered a modest 4.6 % increase for the quarter ended Sept. 29 to $ 113 million , or 87 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 107.9 million , or 84 cents a share .
Proceeds of the Adobe sale brought net income in the quarter to $ 161.1 million , or $ 1.24 a share .
Apple shares fell 75 cents in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 48 a share .
Fiscal fourth-quarter sales grew about 18 % to $ 1.38 billion from $ 1.17 billion a year earlier .
Without the Adobe gain , Apple 's full-year operating profit edged up 1.5 % to $ 406 million , or $ 3.16 a share , from $ 400.3 million , or $ 3.08 a share .
Including the Adobe gain , full-year net was $ 454 million , or $ 3.53 a share .
Sales for the year rose nearly 30 % to $ 5.28 billion from $ 4.07 billion a year earlier .
John Sculley , chairman and chief executive officer , credited the Macintosh and IIcx computers , introduced in the winter , for the brightened sales performance .
Mr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins , which dogged the company through most of 1989 , began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased .
`` Adverse pressure on gross margins... has subsided , '' Mr. Sculley said .
Margins in the fiscal fourth quarter perked up , rising to 51 % from 49.2 % a year earlier .
For all of fiscal 1989 , however , the average gross margin was 49 % , below the average 1988 gross margin of 51 % .
Lower component costs -- especially for DRAMs , or dynamic random access memory chips -- were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company , a spokeswoman said .
Looking ahead to 1990 , Mr. Sculley predicted `` another year of significant revenue growth , '' along with improved profitability , as the recovery in gross margins continues into 1990 .

`` Please submit your offers , '' says Felipe Bince Jr .
He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill .
The agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than $ 80 million .
Not a peso is offered .
Mr. Bince , the trust 's associate executive trustee , declares the bidding a failure .
`` It 's getting harder to sell , '' he mutters as he leaves the room .
Indeed . Recently , the trust failed to auction off the paper mill , a bank , an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant .
Of the four , only the bank and the plant drew bids -- one apiece .
In October 1987 , President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would `` get out of business '' by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos .
Two years later , Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled .
October is a critical month for the privatization program .
Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged .
In addition , the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines , the national carrier , an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls `` the bellwether of privatization . ''
All told , there are assets on the line valued at up to $ 1.03 billion .
The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds .
Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program .
But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference , bureaucratic resistance , a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace , political opposition and government misjudgments .
Most recently , a lack of buyers has been added to the list .
Rather than gathering momentum , the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets .
The axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset , the harder the privatization process .
`` You just do n't see a whole lot happening , '' says an international economist .
To be sure , the program has n't completely stalled .
The Asset Privatization Trust , the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties , has recorded sales of more than $ 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986 .
But its success has been largely in the sale of small , nonperforming companies , which are valued for their assets .
Dealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again .
Ramon Garcia , the Asset Trust 's executive trustee , admits to what he calls `` temporary setbacks . ''
In light of the poor results recently , he says , the agency is adopting an `` attitude of flexibility . ''
October 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank , Associated Bank , for the minimum price of 671 million pesos -LRB- $ 31 million -RRB- .
At the end of the month , the agency again will offer the bank .
But instead of a minimum price , only a target price will be established .
Bankers say , however , that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price .
The bank has a negative net worth , they say .
In addition , special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner , Leonardo Ty , the right to match the highest bid .
Mr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution .
In 1983 , the loans were converted into equity , giving Manila 98 % of the bank , but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights .
His ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers .
Separately , the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines , or Picop , as the paper mill is known .
The price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market .
But according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill , price is n't the only consideration .
As it stands now , the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold .
-LRB- About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity . -RRB-
Potential buyers , mostly foreign companies , are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that , by the government 's own reckoning , needs some $ 100 million in new capital for rehabilitation .
The prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers , including a member of the Elders group of Australia , to pull out of the bidding , the bankers and analysts say .
Mr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer .
Under government regulations , however , foreign ownership of Picop 's equity is limited to 40 % .
Even though the government would retain the 45 % stake in Picop , critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners .
A series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale .
Mr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency .
The question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines , in which it has a 99 % stake .
The carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed .
This maker of electronic measuring devices named two new directors , increasing board membership to nine .
The new directors are Gordon M. Sprenger , president and chief executive officer of LifeSpan Inc. , and Peter S. Willmott , chairman and chief executive officer of Willmott Services Inc .
Gerard E. Wood , 51 years old , was elected president , chief executive officer and a director of this minerals and materials company .
He succeeds Harry A. Durney , 65 , who is retiring from active duty but remains a director and consultant .
Mr. Wood has been president and chief executive of Steep Rock Resources Inc .
Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp. , two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies , agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction .
The new holding company , Bancorp Inc. , will have about $ 1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut .
Tangible capital will be about $ 115 million .
The merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement .
In the merger , each share of Webster , based in Waterbury , will be converted into one share of the new company .
Each share of Eagle , based in Bristol , will become 0.95 share of .
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Eagle shares rose 12.5 cents to $ 11 .
In national over-the-counter trading , Webster shares fell 25 cents to $ 12.375 .
Webster has 3.5 million shares outstanding and Eagle 2.6 million .
Their indicated market values thus are about $ 43.3 million and $ 28.6 million , respectively .
Frank J. Pascale , chairman of Eagle , will be chairman of the new firm and James C. Smith , president and chief executive officer of Webster , will take those posts at .
Harold W. Smith Sr. , chairman of Webster , will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company .
Ralph T. Linsley , vice chairman of Eagle , will become vice chairman of .
The board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company .
In an interview , James Smith said the banks ' `` markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative .
'' Nonperforming loans will make up only about 0.5 % of the combined banks ' total loans outstanding , he said .
At June 30 , Webster , which owns First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury , had assets of $ 699 million .
Eagle , which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington , had assets of $ 469.6 million on that date .
Guillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column , `` Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug , '' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization , and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well .
The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms `` in the context of a larger , world-wide process '' of profound change toward free-market economics , especially in the statist countries .
Having said that , we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case .
It is not quite true , for example , that the Mexican government has `` privatized '' Mexicana de Aviacion , as Mr. Ortiz claims .
In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline .
How can a company be considered `` privatized '' if the state is so heavily represented in it ?
-LRB- True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . -RRB-
Regrettably , too , Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 -LCB- state enterprises -RCB- currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 .
'' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure .
I refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and newsprint .
Those enterprises , however , are not going to be privatized .
They are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution .
In language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. Ortiz writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy . . . . ''
Yet clearly , modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the `` privatization bug . ''
The bottom line , however , is not economic but political reform .
A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to , without having to answer to the public .
To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized , Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability .
Daniel James President Mexico-United States Institute
The board of this Ponce , Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter .

A labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands , according to people familiar with the group .
The group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion .
But to avoid the risk of rejection , the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today .
Instead , the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board 's reaction .
People familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner , British Airways PLC , dropped out .
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange , UAL closed at $ 168.50 a share , down $ 21.625 .
But the pilots union , which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987 , appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace British Air .
Although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks , it believes bank financing could be obtained .
After the collapse of the last effort , the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed .
Under the type of transaction being discussed , the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders .
Those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company .
For example , the group could offer $ 200 a share in cash plus stock valued at $ 30 a share .
UAL currently has 22.6 million shares , fully diluted .
The new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest .
The difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control .
The failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline , with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % .
It was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more than 50 % .
Management 's total could be reduced , and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air .
One option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period .
Although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time .
The board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote , particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale .
The labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board .
However , the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote , Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , who triggered the buy-out with a $ 5.4 billion bid in early August , is hanging back -- apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse .
Three top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week , at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp .
Mr. Davis had paid $ 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid .
But Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group .
On Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future . ''
However , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out .
Also late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer .
But the machinists union , whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid , is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor .
One advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid .
Speculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing , chief financial officer John Pope , may come under pressure to resign .
However , people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time .
Despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing , UAL remains obligated to pay $ 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison .

WEIRTON STEEL Corp. said it completed a $ 300 million sale of 10-year notes , the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from National Steel Corp .
The 10 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said .
Weirton , of Weirton , W. Va. , said $ 60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc. , the parent of National Steel .
Remaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company 's capital spending program .
Lep Group PLC of Britain , which holds a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company .

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mr. Terra said he sold 263,684 First Illinois common shares from Aug. 9 to Aug. 28 for $ 9.9375 to $ 10.5625 a share .
As a result of the sales he holds 6,727,042 shares .
Mr. Terra said in the filing that he sold the stock to decrease his position in the Evanston , Ill. , banking concern .
He may sell more shares in the open market or in private transactions , but would n't rule out changing his intentions and buying shares , the filing said .
SciMed Life Systems Inc. , Minneapolis , said a federal appeals court vacated an earlier summary judgment in its favor .
A lower court in St. Paul had ruled in September 1988 that a heart catheter SciMed manufactures does n't infringe on a patent owned by Advanced Cardiovascular Systems , a unit of Eli Lilly & Co .
SciMed said the appeals court remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings .
In national over-the-counter trading Friday , SciMed shares tumbled $ 2.75 to $ 43 .
SciMed said it `` remains committed '' both to the `` vigorous defense '' of its position that the catheter does n't infringe the Lilly unit 's patent , and to the pursuit of its own counterclaims , which allege Lilly engaged in antitrust violations and other wrongful acts .
A REVISED BID FOR UAL is being prepared by a labor-management group , sources said .
The new proposal , which would transfer majority ownership of United Air 's parent to employees and leave some stock in public hands , would be valued at $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or as much as $ 5.42 billion .
But UAL 's board is n't expected to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share bid that collapsed recently .
Takeover stock speculators have incurred paper losses of over $ 700 million from the failed UAL offer , their worst loss ever on a single deal .

Inmac Corp. , a money-losing direct marketer of computer supplies and accessories , said directors suspended payment of its semiannual dividend as too great a drain on funds .
The company paid five cents a share in April .
The directors ' action , taken Oct. 10 but announced Friday , had little or no effect on the company 's stock , which stagnated at $ 4.75 in light over-the-counter trading .
Inmac recently disclosed a $ 12.3 million write-off related to a corporate restructuring that resulted in the company 's posting a $ 6.4 million net loss for the year ended July 29 , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 9.7 million , or $ 1.02 a share .
Sales rose 12 % to $ 249.5 million from $ 222.8 million .
`` The board felt that the continued payment of our semiannual dividend was inconsistent with recent operating results , '' said Kenneth A. Eldred , president and chief executive officer .
`` All our efforts are now focused on improving earnings to the point where we can fund additional new-country development , continue to invest in the business and reinstate the dividend , '' he added .
The company offers more than 3,500 parts and supplies directly to microcomputer and minicomputer users through catalog sales .
The Food and Drug Administration said American Home Products Corp. agreed to recall certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum Pharmics unit in Amityville , N.Y .
Quantum stopped shipping the drugs last month , following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals .
The FDA requested the recall of Quantum 's mioxidil tablets , chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because , it said , the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was .
American Home Products , based in New York , agreed to recall four other products , trazadone , doxepin , diazepam and lorazapam , because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA .
No safety problems with the products are known , the FDA said .
An FDA spokesperson said the drugs are still available under other brand names .
Last month , American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum 's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit .
It also temporarily closed Quantum , because of the internal investigation , as well as the FDA 's ongoing inquiry .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , American Home Products rose 75 cents to $ 105 on Friday .
Lyondell Petrochemical Co. said third-quarter net income fell 54 % , to $ 73 million , or 91 cents a share , from $ 160 million a year .
Year-earlier per-share results are n't applicable because the company went public in January .
Revenue rose 7.7 % to $ 1.28 billion from $ 1.18 billion .
The petrochemical maker said the biggest reason earnings declined was a loss of production time and the increased costs associated with a temporary maintenance closing and expansion of an olefins plant .
Like other refiners , Lyondell 's margins for chemicals and gasoline were narrower .
While the company said chemical margins continued to worsen this quarter , costs will be lower because the maintenance and expansions are complete .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Lyondell was unchanged at $ 18.50 a share .
Four former Cordis Corp. officials were acquitted of federal charges related to the Miami-based company 's sale of pacemakers , including conspiracy to hide pacemaker defects .
Jurors in U.S. District Court in Miami cleared Harold Hershhenson , a former executive vice president ; John Pagones , a former vice president ; and Stephen Vadas and Dean Ciporkin , who had been engineers with Cordis .
Earlier this year , Cordis , a maker of medical devices , agreed to plead guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges related to the pacemakers and to pay the government about $ 5.7 million in fines and other costs .
Cordis sold its pacemaker operations two years ago to Telectronics Holding Ltd. of Australia .
PAPERS : Management and unions representing 2,400 employees at Torstar Corp. 's Toronto Star reached a tentative contract agreement Friday , averting a strike by most employees of Canada 's largest daily newspaper .
Members of the largest union , representing 1,700 workers , voted in favor of the pact yesterday .
Four other unions have yet to vote , but their leadership also recommended approval .
The pact proposes a 2 contract with a raise of 8 % in the first year , 7 % in the second and 4 % for the final six months .
Amgen Inc. said its second-quarter earnings increased more than tenfold to $ 3.9 million , or 22 cents a share , due to increased sales of the company 's new antianemia drug for kidney patients .

In East Germany , where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism , they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz .
Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him .
`` You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes , '' says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends .
`` With Krenz , we just do n't know what to expect . ''
Mr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker .
But he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either .
According to East Germany 's ADN news agency , Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies .
Already last week , Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media .
On Thursday , a day after he took office , East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer .
The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost .
`` It was quite a shock , '' says a 43-year-old East German shopkeeper .
`` For the first time in my life , I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television . ''
Other changes , including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans , are expected .
But whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans , who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes , depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz .
And that 's a problem .
Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators .
`` I hope he grows with the job , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin .
`` The most important thing is that he have a chance . ''
Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades .
Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions .
Indeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev .
He was later shown on television , fielding questions .
At one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies .
The worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel . People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . ''
The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies .
This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring .
Rather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen . ''
Rep. Ronnie Flippo -LRB- D. , Ala. -RRB- , one of the members of the delegation , says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change .
`` He 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
But there 's another side to Mr. Krenz .
Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland , he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus .
He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron , Mr. Honecker , and emerged as the heir apparent .
Barbara Donovan , an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich , says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image , but she doubts he 's a true reformer .
Even if he is , she adds , he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo .
Against this background , the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing .
The sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary , has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953 .
`` He does n't have any honeymoon period , '' says a Western diplomat based in East Berlin .
`` But if he 's sharp and quick , he has a chance . ''
The diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him .
The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations .
And his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man .
For average East Germans , Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle .
`` Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now , '' says a 30-year-old East German doctor .
`` Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed . ''
The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning .
The walls of the church are covered with leaflets , news clippings , and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition .
`` I have to come here to read the walls , '' says the doctor , `` because it 's information I still ca n't get through the newspapers . ''
Meanwhile , East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor .
Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production .
East Germans remember a comment a few years ago by Kurt Hager , the government 's top ideologist , that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper , there 's no reason to change your own .
His point was there is no reason for East Germany to copy Soviet-style changes .
`` It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny , '' says the East Berlin shopkeeper , `` But everyone I know laughed about it .
The list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from `` cold fusion '' experiments is slowly growing .
But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms .
New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions , leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures .
The latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in 24 reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society , the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments .
The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research .
Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting , fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end .
This was in contrast with the society 's meeting last May , at the height of the controversy , when more than 1,500 scientists , along with scores of reporters and TV crews , crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject .
Neither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar , Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons , were at the meeting .
But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience .
The committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research .
Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new , more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons .
The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into `` heavy '' water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium .
When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy water did begin to break up , or dissociate .
Ordinarily the electrolysis , or breakup , of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy .
But Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat .
The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in , they reported .
Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation , they asserted that the `` excess '' heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod .
As of last weekend , a dozen labs also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely .
One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani , professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota .
Mr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results .
But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat .
`` The results were fascinating , '' he said .
On the fourth `` run '' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat .
The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument .
When it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down , he said .
Typical of other experiments , Mr. Oriani said his experiment was `` very erratic . ''
It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down .
The excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water .
Mr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested .
`` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he said .
Other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time .
The bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on .
One chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat .
One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .
Typically , the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt .
One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells .
A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it , reported Turgut M. Gur , an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins , head of the Stanford experimental team .
One of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University .
Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water .
He said that within the past few days , he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium .
There is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water , so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon .
Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons , which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions , continue to be negative .
Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable .
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays .
A number of times they detected neutrons in one , sometimes two , of the three detectors , but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event .
Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it .
In subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time .
They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment .
At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California , new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted , reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory .
Dow Jones & Co. announced Wall Street Journal advertising rates for 1990 .
The rates , which take effect Jan. 2 , include a 4 % increase for national edition advertising .
The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts .

Reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending , Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31 % and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier .
Net fell to $ 65 million , or 67 cents a common share , from $ 93.7 million or $ 1.03 a share , a year ago .
Sales fell 2.5 % to $ 1.54 billion from $ 1.58 billion .
For the nine months , the electronics and defense concern had net of $ 255.8 million , or $ 2.70 a share , down 5.6 % from $ 271 million , or $ 3.01 a share , in the year-ago period .
Sales were $ 4.66 billion , up 1.3 % from $ 4.6 billion .
Jerry Junkins , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors .
That , coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense , contributed to the decline in sales and profit .
In addition , cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a $ 10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments ' defense-electronics division also reduced net .
However , the quarter results included $ 28 million in royalty income from patent licenses , up from $ 21 million in the year-earlier period .
The nine months include $ 125 million of royalty income , up from $ 98 million last year .
Mr. Junkins was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook , hinting that further workforce reductions may be needed .
`` We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market , '' he said , `` and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand . ''
Further , he said , an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the Information Technology Group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount .
Lynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for $ 20 million plus assumption of $ 24 million of debt .
Western New Mexico Telephone , Silver City , had net income of $ 1.9 million on revenue of about $ 10 million last year .
It is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico .
It is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico .
The transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business .
The company , which has interests in television , trucking services , and glass-making and food-processing equipment , said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry .
Nelson Bunker Hunt on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal .
Silver , now trading around $ 5 an ounce , surged to an all-time peak of $ 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around $ 9 in mid-1979 .
`` Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression , '' says Lesley Edgar , managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. , London bullion brokers .
While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. Edgar says .
Photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions .
Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes .
Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver , dealers say .
Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers say .
Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say .
Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say .
Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .
Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s .
`` Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals , '' says Frederick R. Demler , analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc .
A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S. , he says .
Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union .
Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says .
Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he says .
Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces .
Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. Demler says .
Despite intermittent rallies in the past few years , improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range .
`` There 's just too much silver around , '' says Tom Butler , an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. , a London bullion house .
A huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant , says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report .
This year alone , inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped `` by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors , says Rhona O'Connell , London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton .
`` Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend , '' Ms. O'Connell says .
Moreover , while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does n't have the same mystique , dealers say .
Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold , says Urs Seiler , senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland .
Yet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he says .
However , dealers caution that any increase would be $ 1 to $ 2 at most .
Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : Livestock and Meats Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots .
After the close of trading Friday , the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1 , down 6 % from that date a year earlier .
Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline .
Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter , so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef .
The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year-earlier quarter .
Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placements for the quarter .
In the 1988 quarter , many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches .
The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable .
A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy .
The Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5 % from the 1988 quarter , which was in line with projections by analysts .
Energy Friday 's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to $ 19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board .
Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions .
Barring any petroleum-related news events , trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm .
Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon .
For example , copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound .
Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes .
On Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia .
In Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force .
The mine is expected to return to production in about a week .
On Friday , selling dominated the afternoon `` curb '' session in London , which takes place at noon EDT .
The premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash copper .
Long-term support for the December contract was believed to be at $ 1.25 a pound .
A technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it .
That brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading .
`` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said Ben Hanauer , a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. , a major commodities trading and brokerage firm .
But whether this price break has implications for this week , he said , `` we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning . ''
Another analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued .
Bernard Savaiko , senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks , they perceived a bearish sign .
He also noted that the Japanese , who had been buying at prices just above the $ 1.25 level , apparently pulled back from the market on Friday .
Mr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $ 1.05 a pound .
Hewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other .
Called Task Broker , the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together .
If a machine has a big computing task , Task Broker asks other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job .
It then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine .
Hewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast .
The new Hewlett-Packard program , said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. , a computer-market research company , `` is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . ''
In today 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed .
With the Hewlett-Packard program , he said , `` You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers . ''
The program , which will be shipped in January 1990 , runs on the Unix operating system .
Hewlett-Packard will charge $ 5,000 for a license covering 10 users .
The program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford , Conn .
Hewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines .
The Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network .
A previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
But programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system .
Applications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work .
The Task Broker `` turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer , '' said Bill Kay , general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group .
Price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees .
`` When elephants start fighting , ants get killed , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains .
As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions .
The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees .
The chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain .
Though Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower .
And Bill Konopnicki , a Safford , Ariz. , licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board , says some fast-food outlets `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . ''
Until recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum .
But early this year , PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions , says John Rohs , an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co .
That brought a chain reaction in the industry .
The situation was further aggravated early this month , when McDonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons .
It also decided to go national with pizza , which it has been test-marketing .
Now , two-for-one deals on pizza are common ; so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high .
The discounting , say fast-food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before .
The result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less .
Joe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level .
`` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says .
Alan D'Agosto , president of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . ''
With fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . ''
If the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest .
`` The industry is overbuilt , '' he says .
`` Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . ''
The National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available .
With the market so crowded , says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus , Ohio , `` If you 're doing well , you 're doing well at someone else 's expense . ''
Simply put , there is n't enough business for every store to grow .
According to Mr. Rohs , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 , except for August .
`` McDonald 's has also been running negative all year , '' the analyst says .
Spokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations .
Jack Greenberg , executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald 's , says the company does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales .
He adds that short-term comparisons `` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year . ''
Profit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. `` are holding up quite nicely , '' says Mr. Greenberg .
Profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s , he adds .
But Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers .
Smaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail , many in the industry predict .
Big franchise groups `` can ride out the storm a lot longer , '' says Mr. Harty , the Burger King operator in New York .
The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees .
Mr. Morrissey , the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers .
Franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting .
But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients .
He says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing .
In any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions .
Says Mr. Riese of National Restaurants : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise .

CalMat Co. said it completed a $ 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of $ 12 million .
CalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt , concrete , rock and sand .
And you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an IRS audit .
Reggie Jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them .
Mr. Jackson , who won the nickname `` Mr. October '' for his World Series exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $ 500 each .
Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual .
`` I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says Jack Smalling , a dealer in Ames , Iowa , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs .
An initial batch of Mr. Jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend .
Mr. Jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well .
`` For someone who has everything else -- Reggie 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition , '' says William Vizas , owner of Bill 's Sports Collectibles in Denver , who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show .
For years , the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold .
But these players were dead .
`` Maybe three years ago , there were a lot of -LCB- Ty -RCB- Cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks , '' says Mr. Smalling .
However , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way .
`` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs Bob Machon , owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park , Calif .
`` Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now ? ''
And Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now .
`` I do n't think the checks are worth $ 15 apiece , '' he says .
Why Mr. Jackson , who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear .
He probably has n't done it for the cash .
`` I would say he 's definitely not in need of money , '' says Matt Merola , an agent of Mr. Jackson 's based in New York .
`` He has good investments . ''
And Mr. Jackson probably has opened new checking accounts , too .
Or at least he should .
`` I assume those accounts are closed , '' says Mr. Smalling , referring to the accounts of the canceled checks .
`` I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers .
USX Corp. and its Japanese partner , Kobe Steel Ltd. , agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market .
Terms were n't disclosed for the plant , which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons .
The move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies .
Bethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel .
The surge in production , analysts say , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand .
They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in .
`` There 's too much capacity , '' contended Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .
`` I do n't think there 's anyone not building one . ''
He does add , however , that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos , instead of relying heavily on imported steel .
That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet .
The hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees .
Indeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 .
For the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % .
USX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 .
USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production .
Moreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .
The company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines .
Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel , which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel .
One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right ?
You just call your broker and say `` buy '' or `` sell . ''
Dream on .
There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing .
So here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges .
Two things to keep in mind : Not all exchanges accept every type of order .
And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer .
Market Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions .
With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . ''
It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . ''
For example , if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price .
A recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers .
Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers .
Limit Order : Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment .
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .
Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 .
A limit order to sell could be entered at that price .
One risk : Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls .
Unless the market goes at least one tick -LRB- the smallest price increment permitted -RRB- beyond the limit price , investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price .
Stop Order : Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level .
Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get .
Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above .
In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do .
An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday .
Stop-Limit Order : Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order .
Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price .
If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled .
Investors who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled .
But if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price .
Market-If-Touched Order : Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached .
However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it .
As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price .
Fill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades .
It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .
But if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled .
Gregory Bessemer , who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship , says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options .
`` I like to use them to feel out the market , '' he says .
`` If they do n't fill it immediately , then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price . ''
Not-Held Order : This is another timing order .
It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting .
Not-held orders , which are also known as `` disregard the tape '' orders , are always done at the customer 's risk .
One-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order .
In a fast-moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security .
Specific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time .
`` On the close '' can be added to many types of orders .
For example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange .
`` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading .
`` Day orders '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date .
Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise .
On Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them .
They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel .
It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed .
Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are , usually , stuck with the consequences .
Mr. Angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for The Wall Street Journal .
IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments , there 's probably no starting place better than `` beta . ''
But investors better not ignore its limitations , either .
Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund .
For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall .
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret .
The beta of the broad market , typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , is always 1.0 .
So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on .
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas .
Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market .
Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations .
`` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says William F. Sharpe , the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure .
`` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . ''
In particular , beta does n't measure the company - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock .
That `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks , but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio .
Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer .
In particular , the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down , but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired .
Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide .
`` Our fear was people would look just at the beta -LCB- of a gold fund -RCB- and say here is an investment with very low risk , '' says John Markese , director of research for the Chicago-based group .
`` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements .
READY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio ?
First , a pop quiz .
When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ?
Pencils down .
If you 're like most people , you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding .
`` People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension , '' says Timothy Kochis , national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte , Haskins & Sells .
But therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others .
This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs .
Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds .
U.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity .
But their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments .
Risk is also a function of time .
When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns .
Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills , for example , because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider .
That is usually measured by the standard deviation , or divergence , of annual results from the average return over time .
But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals .
For instance , some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings .
But the stock market , despite some stomach-churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods .
By retreating to the apparent security of , say , money-market funds , investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement .
`` That 's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives , '' says Steven B. Enright , a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services .
As a result , financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios .
They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year .
They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals .
And they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified .
The portfolios of two hypothetical families , one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 , illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider .
For instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk .
But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk .
The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue .
Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return , 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % , as calculated by Seidman Financial Services , which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman .
That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings .
But one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility , as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio .
-LRB- Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure : Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it .
Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation .
In two of three years , the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate .
Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range .
There 's a 95 % probability any year 's result will fall in the range . -RRB-
Of course , the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals .
Indeed , the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans .
`` They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market , '' says John H. Cammack , a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington .
`` But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . ''
Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau .
When it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded : Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will

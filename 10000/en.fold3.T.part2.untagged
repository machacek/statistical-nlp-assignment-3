When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period , the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines .
The open-year accounting practice `` is widely recognized within Lloyd 's as of serious concern '' to the 31,329 member investors , who underwrite insurance at Lloyd 's in return for premium and investment income , Lloyd 's said .
As a result , the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open .
Under the new rules , the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from actuaries , including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably .

Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate John D. Rockefeller , Lake View Cemetery has fallen on hard times .
The ads celebrate the achievements of some of Lake View 's residents .
Another focuses on Charles Brush , the first person to light a city electrically .
Street lights , the ad points out , `` helped sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player . ''
Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out-of-repair and crime-infested cemetery .
`` We do n't want to be known as ambulance chasers , '' says William Garrison , Lake View 's president .
A pleasant place to come and spend a few hours . ''
For example , President James A. Garfield is entombed here , the victim of an assassination in 1881 .
Mr. Rockefeller , buried beneath a 180-foot-tall granite obelisk , did n't seem right for an ad either .
But there are plenty of other promising prospects at Lake View , promoters believe : Ernest Ball , for instance , who wrote `` When Irish Eyes are Smiling , '' and Garrett Morgan , the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light .

Mr. Dempsey estimated that the issue 's London debut was accompanied by `` very , very heavy turnover -- between five million and six million shares . ''
Official trading in the shares will start in London , Paris and Brussels on Nov. 6 , when the French-franc denominated offering , valued at the equivalent of nearly $ 1 billion , comes to market in the European Community .
Because of the interest connected with the issue , the London exchange took the unusual step of letting traders establish an officially sanctioned when-issued market .
In contrast to the London performance , Euro Disney there closed down three francs yesterday , at 79 francs -LRB- $ 12.66 -RRB- bid , but still about 10 % over the 72-franc offering price .

The statement was part of a Ford filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .

He emphasized that the car maker only would bid for all of Jaguar under the right circumstances , and said `` those circumstances are n't right or possible at the moment . ''
Since then , Jaguar officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with GM and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month .
But the specter of Ford eventually launching a full-fledged bid could unravel the GM-Jaguar talks .
He predicted Ford officials will meet with Jaguar executives in the next week to outline their proposed offer .
As for GM , its `` fallback position has to be a full bid itself , '' said Stephen Reitman , European auto-industry analyst at London brokers UBS-Phillips & Drew .
They will have to throw their hat in the ring . ''
A pitched battle could mean Jaguar would fetch # 10 -LRB- $ 16.02 -RRB- a share , or about # 1.8 billion -LRB- $ 2.88 billion -RRB- , several analysts believe .
U.S. takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated 25 % of Jaguar shares .
In the U.S. , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents in over-the-counter trading , to $ 11.25 .
And financially strapped Jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know-how .
Ford 's need to acquire some or all of Jaguar became more acute last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its German-built Merkur Scorpio sedan as a European luxury import in the U.S .
GM 's interest in Jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the U.S. company 's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market .
GM officials also see a lot of potential in marrying Jaguar 's cars to the technological know-how of Group Lotus PLC , a British engineering and specialty car maker GM bought in 1986 .
Sun Co. also reported higher earnings .
Texaco 's exploration and production earnings improved as a result of its streamlining of those operations as it sold many of its marginal producing properties over the past 18 months .
The sale of a portion of refining and marketing operations to Saudi Arabia helped alleviate the decline in earnings from that business .
Third-quarter net income at Texaco rose to $ 305 million from $ 274 million last year .
Per-share earnings declined to $ 1.10 a share from $ 1.12 a share , largely because of 21 million additional shares issued to retire $ 1 billion of debt .
Sun Sun Co. 's net income climbed 18 % to $ 85 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 72 million , or 67 cents a share .
Sun said some of the growth reflects higher earnings in the oil sands operation of Suncor , a majority-owned Canadian subsidiary .
Overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the North Sea Magnus Field , a portion of which was acquired by Sun earlier this year .
Profits of Shell , a subsidiary of the Royal Group , tumbled $ 24 million , or 6.6 % , to $ 340 million , despite a gain of $ 30 million from an insurance settlement .

Two Japanese scientists said they discovered an antibody that , in laboratory test-tube experiments , kills AIDS-infected cells while preserving healthy cells .
The drug AZT , the only treatment currently on the market , claims only to help stop the spread of AIDS , not to cure it .
And the researchers themselves acknowledged they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans .
The antibody then kills the cell .
In some of the experiments , it killed almost all the infected cells , the researchers said .
The two said they must still do more laboratory tests , then experiment on animals .
Japan does n't have enough AIDS patients to do significant experimentation in that country , they said .
But Takashi Kitamura , director of the biology department at Japan 's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government 's AIDS-research center , said , `` I 'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods . ''

But he and Dr. Yonehara said there were still several uncertainties , particularly regarding possible side effects .

Dr. Kitamura said about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan , and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests .
AZT is the world 's only prescription medicine approved for treating the disease .
A Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan .

The United Kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $ 750 million purchase of a 15 % stake in UAL .
British Airways said its shareholders accepted only 6.3 % of the convertible capital bonds , but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters .
`` It is close to being a record undersubscription , '' said Bob Bucknell , an analyst with London broker Smith New Court Securities .
The obvious reason was -LRB- for British Air -RRB- to buy a stake in United Airlines . ''
But except for the embarrassment , British Air will emerge relatively unscathed from the flopped issue .
Lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by sub-underwriting the issue among U.K. institutional investors .
In any case , he added , `` most institutions probably wo n't sell '' the bonds .
`` From a cash flow point of view , British Airways is better off not being in United Airlines in the short term , '' said Andy Chambers , an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London .
For instance , British Air is continuing to negotiate with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines about each acquiring a 20 % stake in Sabena World Airlines , the air transport subsidiary of the Belgian national airline .
The failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on British Air shares .

Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden-Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union .
With many rural districts yet to report ballots , election officials estimate support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage points statewide .
Headed by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric , the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin , Hesse and North-Rhine Westphalia .
Election analysts acknowledge that a `` Red-Green '' coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl 's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues to spread .

As of June 30 , 1989 -- the day our past fiscal year came to a close -- only 4.1 % of the Bank 's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months .
Moreover , the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $ 800 million against possible loan losses .
Because of the business-like manner in which the Bank goes about development , financial markets have confidence in it .
Another of Mr. Roberts 's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good `` by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development . ''
The reality is that Bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years .
By and large , these efforts have borne fruit .
Mr. Roberts also takes a swipe at the Bank 's adjustment lending .
The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years .
Typically , these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy , to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector .
Over the years , it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the International Finance Corp .
These are not the actions of a development agency wed to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government , as Mr. Roberts alleges .

The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food-poisoning outbreaks linked to canned Chinese mushrooms .
The agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until `` satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent '' bacterial contamination .
In subsequent tests , the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated .
A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March .
The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants .

Ramada Inc. revised the terms of its restructuring and extended to Feb. 28 , 1990 , the deadline to complete the sale of its hotel business to New World Development Co. of Hong Kong and Prime Motor Inns Inc. of Fairfield , N.J .
Under the new terms , New World will still pay $ 540 million for Ramada 's hotel business , subject to adjustment at closing , but Ramada will now reimburse New World for $ 10 million in expenses .
Revised terms call for each Ramada common share to be exchanged for $ 1 in cash , subject to possible reduction , and one share of Aztar common stock .
The cash payout will be reduced by 40 % of any amount by which the weighted mean price of Ramada 's common stock exceeds $ 14 on the day the transaction closes .
Ramada 's stock rose 87.5 cents on the news to close at $ 11.25 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading .
The previous deadline to complete the sale was Nov. 30 .

The Des Moines-based publisher said it created a new Custom Marketing Group that will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines , such as Ladies Home Journal and Better Homes and Gardens .
Earlier this year , Meredith sold its first such package for $ 3 million to Kraft Inc. , now a unit of New York-based Philip Morris Cos .
Kraft recently agreed to spend an additional $ 3 million on similar programs through 1990 .
Sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with Meredith said leading advertisers in consumer electronics , packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the Meredith group .
The New York Times Co. 's Magazine Group earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its Golf Digest magazine .
Paul DuCharme , director of media services at Grey Advertising , said Meredith is the leader in providing multimedia packages .
Mr. Murphy of Meredith said one advertiser , which he would n't identify , wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines , publish an interior-decorating book that will be distributed at point of purchase , give away a videotape on installation pointers , and possibly use Meredith 's Better Homes and Gardens ' residential real-estate agents to distribute discount-coupon books to new homeowners .

Their `` secret '' is that they gather a small group of advisers around them , listen to what they have to say , prepare a business plan and they are on their way .
Unfortunately , they are in the minority .
It 's unfortunate so many must learn the hard way .
The management turnover at Reebok International Ltd. continued with the resignation of company president C. Joseph LaBonte , who joined Reebok just two years ago .
The resignations by the two executives , considered hard-charging and abrasive by Reebok insiders , reflect a difference in style with Paul Fireman , chairman and chief executive , according to several former executives .
The changes come as Reebok , which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late , is seeking to regain momentum in the athletic-shoe business against rivals Nike Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc .
`` I think it 's more an issue of style .
The company can go about its business .
Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20 % decline last year .
Reebok said Mr. LaBonte will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc. , a California-based venture capital firm that he founded in 1983 .
Reebok added that Mr. Fireman will assume the title of president .
`` We will not be commenting beyond the news release , '' the spokesman said .
Magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles .
At the American Magazine Conference here , publishers are plenty worried about the industry 's woes .
For example , Toronto-based Telemedia Inc. will publish Eating Well , a new food and health magazine due out next summer .
And Time Warner Inc. is developing a spinoff of Time magazine aimed at kids , on the heels of its successful Sports Illustrated for Kids .
`` This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry , '' said Mr. Kummerfeld .
And despite the recent tough advertising climate , industry figures released at the meeting here indicate things may be turning around .
Total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased 12 % to $ 4.6 billion .
Though some magazines are thriving , the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business .
Lang is cutting costs and will attempt to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue .
Mr. Lipstein 's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble .
`` The magazine is strong .
`` Magazines can no longer be considered institutions , '' said James Autry , president of Meredith Corp. 's magazine group .
`` Magazines could , like other brands , find that they have only a limited life . ''
More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as American Express Publishing Corp. , a unit of American Express Co. , and Conde Nast Publications Inc. , a unit of Advance Publications Inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers .
Gerry Ritterman , president of New York-based Network Publishing Corp. , earlier this year sold his Soap Opera Digest magazine to Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp .
He would not reveal which magazines he is considering .
`` They could be old or new , but they are magazines whose editorial quality needs to be improved .
MCA Inc. said its toy-making unit agreed to buy Buddy L Corp. , producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products .

In June 1980 , Michele Sindona -- an Italian financier who in July 1972 had bought a 22 % block of Franklin 's stock from Loews Corp. , headed by Laurence A. Tisch -- was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and perjury .

A squiggly line snakes across a video screen , gyrating erratically as subjects with hand-held computers register their second-by-second reactions to a speaker 's remarks .
In another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how people 's opinions were shaped -- and how they can be reshaped .
He heads Litigation Sciences Inc. , the nation 's largest legal consulting firm , which is helping corporate America prepare for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions .
Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within , Litigation Sciences , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC , employs more than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians .
Among other services , the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' jurors , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' juries , coaches lawyers and witnesses , and designs courtroom graphics .
With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time , companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice .
It advised the National Football League in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League .
Largely as a result , Litigation Sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years .
Meanwhile , competitors are being spawned almost daily ; some 300 new businesses -- many just one-person shops -- have sprung up .
In any high-stakes case , you can be sure that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants .
Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in civics texts and memorialized on the movie screen .
After hours of conflict and debate , that jury focuses on the facts with near-perfect objectivity .
Litigation consulting is , as New York trial attorney Donald Zoeller puts it , `` highly manipulative . ''
But the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally .
But Mr. Zoeller also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective .
Others complain that the consultants ' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services .
Sophisticated trial consulting grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases .
In that case , a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg .
The defense also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War .
Ultimately , that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit , and the prosecution decided not to retry the case .
The fledgling science went corporate in 1977 when International Business Machines Corp. hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case .
As the trial progressed , they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them .
He then briefed Messrs. Boies and Barr , who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation accordingly .
Mr. Vinson , the professor , got the law bug and formed Litigation Sciences .
`` The hardest thing in any complex case is to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , '' says Mr. Boies of Cravath , Swaine & Moore .
A shadow jury is a way to do that in a more systematic and organized way . ''
Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow .
The jurors , who did n't know which side had retained them , decided for Energy Transportation , and awarded $ 500 million in damages .
`` It 's just like weather forecasting , '' says Energy Transportation trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins .
Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences ' work .
And to the uninitiated , some of the firm 's approaches may seem chillingly manipulative .
Instead , Mr. Vinson says , interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe-horn the facts of the case to fit their views .
If it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages , for example , depressed , underemployed people are far more likely to grant them .
So would someone recently divorced or widowed .
For personal-injury cases , Litigation Sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people , including victims , get what they deserve .
The consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books .
If a client needs prejudiced jurors , the firm will help find them .
They are what they are .
In our system of advocacy , the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can . ''
Logic plays a minimal role here .
In one personal-injury case , a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool , but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was discolored bluish .
The ploy worked .
In a classic defense of a personal-injury case , the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame .
Slick graphics , pre-tested for effectiveness , also play a major role in Litigation Sciences ' operation .
Computer-generated videos help .
They are very visually sophisticated , '' explains LSI graphics specialist Robert Seltzer .
Supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate , but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics .
`` What you have here is intuition made manifest . ''
Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment -- and used that to advantage .
Litigation Sciences concedes that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions .
Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury tick .
He says he used consultants in the case but `` found them to be virtually useless . ''
And the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while undergoing such a skillful massage .
`` There 's no reason to believe that juries rule inappropriately , '' he says .
What you then do is you make them think inappropriately . ''
In most civil cases , judges allow each side three such challenges .
Mr. Etzioni also suggests forbidding anyone from gathering background information about the jurors .
Furthermore , he says , psychologists should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' personalities .
Mr. Boies , the first lawyer to use Mr. Vinson 's services , cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning -LRB- known as voir dire -RRB- or giving out personal information about the jurors .
Silicon Graphics Inc. , a fast-growing maker of computer workstations , said it landed two federal government contracts worth more than $ 100 million over the next five years .
The other involves the sale of about 35 of the company 's high-end workstations to the National Institutes of Health .
The awards are evidence that Silicon Graphics ' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers , analysts said .
`` No other -LCB- computer -RCB- vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price . ''
Silicon Graphics , on the other hand , has targeted a specific niche since its inception in 1982 , which has been dubbed by some as `` motion-picture computing . ''
Though Silicon Graphics is much smaller than Digital , Hewlett and Sun , it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market .
A year ago , Silicon Graphics introduced a model priced at $ 15,000 -- almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features .
`` It 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by 30 % to 40 % a year , '' said Edward McCracken , the company 's chief executive officer .

Remember those bulky , thick-walled refrigerators of 30 years ago ?
That something , whatever it is , could add as much as $ 100 to the $ 600 or so consumers now pay for lower-priced refrigerators .
In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual value of $ 135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB- .
The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0 .
That 's a lot of banishment , as it turns out .
Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows , upholstery and insulation .
But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ 100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants , foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes , the Montreal Protocol 's legions of supporters say it is worth it .
Hence , as they see it , if something is n't done earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer .
In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming , a theory that mankind 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a `` greenhouse effect '' that will work important climatic changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time .
`` In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently .
We ca n't afford to wait . ''
Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate , the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10 % by the middle of the next century .
Moreover , there are questions , particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best , about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer .
But ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture .
What scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year .
Moreover , surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems , running for many years without either the CFC gas or the insulation ever escaping .
Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none , so far , match the nonflammable , nontoxic CFCs .
Moreover , new lubricants will be needed to protect compressors from the new formulations , which , as with CFCs , are solvents .
Folks in the Midwest who just suffered a mid-October snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it , but let 's not be flippant about grave risks .
It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs .
Maybe we should ask why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement , giving it wide publicity , that it was withdrawing CFCs .
One answer is that big companies are growing weary of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them , although they never care to put it quite that way .
Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one , and is building a plant in Louisiana to produce it .
There are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise .
University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for `` alternative energy . ''
In other words , environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few .
There is an element of make-work involved .
If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster , the price would be cheap .
but worries about 1990 .
Much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes -- from raising state minimum wage levels to mandating benefits in health plans .
Five states -- Oregon , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , Iowa and Wisconsin -- passed bills to boost the minimum wage , but measures in 19 other states were defeated .
Iowa 's will be the second highest -- at $ 4.65 an hour in January 1992 -- but small-business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate .
The Illinois Legislature narrowly passed a parental-leave bill , which Gov. James Thompson vetoed , and Iowa and Tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for breast-cancer exams .
`` Those kinds of issues always keep coming back , '' says Robert Beckwith , who manages the Illinois Chamber of Commerce 's small-business office .
Only two states -- Vermont and Washington -- this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants .
But small business , which generally detests government-mandated benefits , has taken note of the growing number of close votes .
Consequently , small business is taking more `` pro-active '' steps to counter mandated leaves .
They also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave .
`` We 'll be playing a lot of defense , especially in the Midwest and Northeast , '' says Jim Buente of the NFIB .

CALIFORNIA , A TREND-SETTER in franchising rules , stirs a controversy .
Previously , regulators insisted that franchisers pre-register such changes with the state -- a costly process taking at least six weeks .
For instance , franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who qualify as `` sophisticated purchasers . ''
But critics consider the changes regressive .
He argues California regulators historically have misinterpreted their law -- and he says negotiated sales that are n't pre-registered have been legal all along .

In other words , it was a better-than-average Manhattan commute .
The massive temblor , which killed at least 61 people , severed the Bay Bridge , a major artery to the east , and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101 , the biggest artery to the south .
But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm , gridlock never materialized , mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50 % more passengers than normal .
Moreover , the two main bridges still connecting San Francisco with the East Bay did n't charge tolls , allowing traffic to zip through without stopping .
Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge , which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span , actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday , provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations .
Not that getting into town was easy .
Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray , stranding commuters such as Marilyn Sullivan .
Yesterday , she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours , trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district .
`` I do n't know where all the buses are . ''
`` It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had , '' said Charles Catania , an insurance broker on the bus from Mill Valley in Marin County .
I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . ''
At the San Mateo Bridge , which connects the San Francisco peninsula with the East Bay , police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved .
There were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role .
Bechtel Group Inc. , the giant closely held engineering concern , says it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement , whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work .
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is offering its 6,000 San Francisco employees a two-tier flextime schedule -- either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Some of the utility 's employees may opt for a four-day workweek , 10 hours a day , to cut the commute by 20 % .
Some individuals went to some lengths on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock .
But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last .
And some commuters , relieved by the absence of gridlock , were planning to return to their old ways .
Playing black in the first game , the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought , known for its attacking prowess , into a totally passive position .
And in the second game , with Mr. Kasparov advancing ferociously as white , D.T. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster .
Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26-year-old Soviet to beat the Pennsylvania-based computer , he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected .
As if he were Iron Mike , about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling , he declared : `` I 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years . ''
`` The computer 's mind is too straight , too primitive , '' lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top , he said .
Its chief builder , Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu , nicknamed his brainchild `` the Weasel '' for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions .
In fact , D.T. never left home , Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link .
But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips ; they needed kryptonite .
No human can examine millions of moves , but Mr. Kasparov , using his ineffably powerful brain , consistently found very good ones .
But the computer did n't play Mr. Short 's ninth move , a key pawn thrust , and its position deteriorated rapidly .
`` Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players , and computers , '' said Edmar Mednis , the expert commentator for the match , which was attended by hundreds of chess fans .
It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T. 's knights .
Indeed , it looked more like a pawn , a `` tall pawn , '' as spectators snidely put it .
When most spectators thought its position hopeless , the computer thought it was only , in effect , one-half of a pawn down .
While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch , Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost .
No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T.
Now , with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood , the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two .
As early as move six , Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves , developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer 's advanced knight .
`` In a new position just after the opening , a computer will have serious problems , '' Mr. Kasparov said later .
After only 11 moves for each side , the computer 's position was shaky .
And when a defensive move was called for , D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats .
Now , after only a dozen moves , spectators were looking for a mating combination .
Mr. Kasparov 's continuation was slower but , in the end , just as deadly .
In a hopeless position , the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move .
`` In both games I got exactly what I wanted , '' he said .
Undeterred , D.T. 's handlers vowed to press on .
Promises Feng-hsiung Hsu : `` In three years we 'll mount a better challenge . ''
Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in .
In May 1986 , Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $ 40,000 for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 % .
Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8 % .
But nearly 3 years later , Merrill says the investment is worth about $ 43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2 % on Dr. Blumenfeld 's $ 40,000 .
Instead , his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD , which is sold at a deep discount to its face value .
More important , the CD was purchased on the secondary , or resale , market .
Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent , and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance .
Several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later , the dentist found out that the $ 9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD , and that the amount was n't insured .
He assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured up to $ 100,000 , '' he adds .
Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect , too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk .
`` The biggest problem we have is that investors realize , after the fact , that they did n't understand what they were investing in . ''
He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs -LRB- Treasury Income Growth Receipts -RRB- , a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch .
The broker , Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch 's Morristown , N.J. , office , refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter , referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York .
The fact sheet , dated April 1986 , says on page three : `` If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs , the difference... is not insured .
Dr. Blumenfeld says he does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium .
Nevertheless , Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld 's CD , Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina , Kan. , is liquidated and the CD terminated , the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid .
`` It 's not a blanket commitment , it 's a case-by-case situation , '' says Albert Disposti , a managing director of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc .
`` We were n't sure that full disclosure , as we wanted it , was being made . ''
Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells , which it did n't provide in 1986 .
Merrill Lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs .
Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued , although interest is n't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education .
But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured .
However , those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid .
Dr. Blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved .
No one else will watch out for you .

In the latest period , the company had an average of 370.8 million shares , 5.6 million shares below last year 's level .
Systemwide sales , which include sales at franchisee as well as company-owned stores , totaled $ 4.59 billion compared with $ 4.2 billion .

That ship , which would carry about 2,050 passengers , would expand the capacity of Carnival 's existing 14-ship fleet by 24 % .
`` There 's a 99 % chance that the Fantasy will be delivered close to schedule , '' said Caroline Levy , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc .
She said the company could pay as much as 25 % more for the ships .
Analysts said those estimates -- which range from about $ 1.80 a share to $ 1.95 a share -- are based on Fantasy being in operation in 1990 .
Analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money Carnival might lose through deposits .
Carnival , for example , has already paid about $ 160 million of the total cost for Fantasy .
According to reports from Finland , Waertsilae Marine , 19%-owned by conglomerate Oy Waertsilae , filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard 's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees .
Designer Sandra Garratt filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code protection , saying that her cash flow had been cut off .
Ms. Garratt was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in March .
Jerell paid Ms. Garratt royalties for the line known as Multiples by Sandra Garratt , which are sold primarily through department stores .
That lawsuit is still pending .
Ms. Garratt 's assets and liabilities were n't disclosed .
Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates , leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels , said Stephen R. Hardis , vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer .
Third-quarter net was $ 40 million , or $ 1.04 a share , from $ 54.4 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year ago .
The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales did n't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do , said Patrick E. Sheridan , analyst with McDonald & Co .
Eli Lustgarten of PaineWebber Inc. , who a couple of weeks ago reduced his 1989 estimate to $ 5.70 a share because of the weakening truck market , says he will make another cut to about $ 5.50 a share in light of the third-quarter report .
Eaton said sales of truck axles , transmissions and other parts fell 7.2 % to $ 295 million .
Eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category , but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell 26 % to $ 51 million on an about 1 % drop in sales to $ 488 million .
The truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods , he said , and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward spiral .
The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market .
Eaton earned from continuing operations $ 165.1 million , or $ 4.40 a share , down 7 % from $ 177.5 million , or $ 4.76 a share , a year earlier .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Eaton closed at $ 57.50 a share , down $ 2.50 .
Initial steps were taken at Poland 's first international environmental conference , which I attended last month .
The conference was entitled `` Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection , '' a significant departure from East Bloc usage , which recognizes only one economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior .
Why did East Bloc participants unanimously endorse market-based pollution approaches ?
Like other East Bloc countries , Poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance .
Norms are consistently exceeded at 60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80 % of those for dust and soot emissions .
Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled .
Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average .
Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from -LRB- a -RRB- Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which are not produced by labor ; -LRB- b -RRB- planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government ; and -LRB- c -RRB- the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West .
The solutions they formally proposed included taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits , and debt-for-environment swaps .
A revolution takes more than conference manifestos .
The Russians are talking peace .
And the Poles are engaged in commerce . ''
Those implications include : -- Privatization
Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries .
-- Least-cost solutions .
That means simple , clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction , deferring more complex issues such as risk .
That 's because quota-trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals .
Even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars .
-- Democratization .
While Polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information .
-- Global reciprocity .
His point : It will be increasingly difficult for the U.S. to cling to command-and-control measures if even the East Bloc steps to a different drummer .
But the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy .
Disappointing earnings news from some technology companies unnerved investors in the over-the-counter market , who sold shares of Apple Computer , Intel and many other computer-related concerns .
It finished at 467.22 , down 3.45 .
Mostly because of the sell-off in technology stocks , the Nasdaq 100 Index of the OTC 's largest non-financial issues dropped 4.58 to 457.52 .
Some traders said the sell-off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by investors .
`` It 's a quiet retreat , '' said Mr. Howley .
Some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies , he said .
Yesterday 's volume of 117.2 million shares was far below last week 's sizzling average of nearly 177 million .
Apple Computer , which reported lackluster earnings Friday , lost 1 to 46 on 1.1 million shares .
Investors apparently did n't like the news from Rainbow Technologies either .
Rainbow 's stock dropped 2 to 14 .
Microsoft , which last week rose to a record , fell victim to profit-taking , traders said , as it declined 2 to 83 .
Among takeover stocks , Jefferson Smurfit jumped 1 to 42 after SIBV-MS Holdings said the price to be paid to Jefferson Smurfit 's minority holders has been raised to $ 43 a share .
SIBV-MS Holdings is a new company jointly owned by an affiliate of Jefferson Smurfit and a Morgan Stanley limited partnership .
These shares will be bought by SIBV-MS Holdings at $ 41.75 each after the acquisition of the minority shares .
LIN 's suitor , McCaw Cellular Communications , dropped 1 to 40 on almost 350,000 shares .
They say investors will favor companies that historically have posted annual earnings growth of 15 % to 20 % .
Michael R. Weisberg , partner in charge of research at Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco , said some investors have already made the switch .
The rise matches that of the Dow Jones industrials this year .
He predicted that the most popular growth companies will be those with `` some kind of unique product or franchise '' that makes them appear able to sustain their momentum .
Nellcor , a maker of electronic patient monitoring systems , was up to 16 on 258,000 shares yesterday , while retailing issue Office Club was unchanged at 10 on 65,200 shares .
Other favorites of growth-stock analysts and money managers also had a mixed session .
But Legent , a systems software stock , was down to 29 on 39,300 shares .
Elsewhere , Valley National continued its slide , dropping 2 to 15 on 1.7 million shares .
Higher earnings helped some issues .
Why ca n't we teach our children to read , write and reckon ?
It 's that we do n't want to .
These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment , our media , our politicians , and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them .
If I were to ask a sample of American parents , `` Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children ? '' the near-unanimous answer would be , `` Yes , of course . ''
No one can say .
The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves .
It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive .
Their commitment to `` creativity '' can not survive adolescent illiteracy .
The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way .
`` Progressive education '' -LRB- as it was once called -RRB- is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction .
It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , '' since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
They could all fairly be described as `` pap '' courses .
I know many schoolteachers and , on the whole , they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching .
But they need not be to do their jobs well .
But our education proceeded at the hands of those others , who were merely competent and conscientious .
If he were brilliant , he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place .
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis .
It is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more .
It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful , since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency .
If there were such evidence , you can be sure you would have heard of it .
There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation , some of them in the poorest of ghettos , and they are all sending us the same message .
We really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking .
They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this is the least controversial option that is open to them .
A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need .
Whether desirable or not , this is a child-care program , not an educational program .
Let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work : -- `` Parental involvement '' is a bad idea .
Parents should be involved with their children 's education at home , not in school .
If parents are dissatisfied with a school , they should have the option of switching to another .
Here , the experience of New York City is decisive .
New York is in the process of trying to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as Chicago and other cities are moving to institute it .
The reason is simple : Education takes place in the classroom , where the influence of money is minimal .
The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers .
That is the way the system works .
No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R 's at the level that prevailed 20 years ago .
The notion that tracking is somehow `` undemocratic '' is absurd .
No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential .
The latter are modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial .
One of the reasons American students do so poorly in math tests , as compared with British , French , German or Japanese students , is the influence of the `` New Math '' on American textbooks and teaching methods .
-- Most important of all , schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matters of student discipline .
With that authority , of course , goes an unambiguous accountability .
This is a fact -- though , in view of all the feathers that are ruffled by this fact , it is not surprising that one hears so little about it .
International Business Machines Corp. unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when computerizing their operations : Most machines ca n't talk to each other .
The aim , ultimately , is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning , marketing and other operations .
But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines , including robots and machine tools .
Consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the IBM strategy to fall into place , even though the specific products IBM unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter .
He said he believes IBM 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology .
IBM 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing .
IBM 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that IBM has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems .
`` We may not have every manufacturing problem , but we have most , '' said George Conrades , IBM 's top marketing official .
Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms -- Nomura Securities Co. , Daiwa Securities Co. , Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities -- also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year ending March 31 , replacing the 12-month term formerly finishing Sept. 30 .
Operating profit , pretax profit and net income results , however , were provided for the immediately preceding six-month period .
Nomura said its pretax profits inched up 0.9 % to 248.91 billion yen -LRB- US$ 1.75 billion -RRB- from 246.60 billion yen in the six months ended March 31 .
Net income , however , rose 3.7 % to 107.87 billion yen from 103.98 billion yen .
Daiwa said its pretax profits surged 9.6 % to 171.04 billion yen from 156.12 billion yen in the preceding six-month term .
Net income jumped 21 % to 79.03 billion yen from 65.53 billion yen .
Yamaichi said its pretax profit increased 8.9 % to 117.94 billion yen from 108.28 billion yen .
Net income surged 21 % to 55.59 billion yen from 46.02 billion yen .
Nikko 's pretax profit rose 1.6 % to 130.25 billion yen from 128.19 billion yen .
Net income rose 23 % to 63.52 billion yen from 51.65 billion yen .
Harken Energy Corp. of Dallas said it will drop its $ 11.75-a-share , or $ 190 million , offer for Tesoro Petroleum Corp. if the two companies do n't have an agreement to merge by Dec. 15 .
Harken also said that its financing from Bankers Trust Co. has been extended until Dec. 15 to give Tesoro 's board time to consider the offer at a Tesoro board meeting scheduled for mid-November .
However , Tesoro , based in Houston , already has rejected a suitor in the past year .
He succeeds Paul J. Montle , 42 , who will remain chairman .
National Environmental , formerly Yankee Cos. , is a sludge treatment company .
Under the accord , Albert Roth , chairman and chief executive officer , and Arthur Chase , Sam Beigel , and Louis Polsky will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer .
Mr. Lurie is currently co-chief executive .
Eagle also said it received a commitment for as much as $ 8 million in financing from Norfolk Capital Group Inc .
A committee representing the unsecured creditors agreed to accept 24 cents on the dollar , Eagle said .
It would extinguish all of Eagle 's existing capital stock and issue new stock to York as sole holder .
In its bankruptcy-law petition , filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan , Eagle said its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then-senior lender , Bankers Trust Co. , reduced its credit line .
Eagle 's management retired and Biny 's management took control of the company .
But Eagle said the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged .
Standard & Poor 's Corp. said it would add John H. Harland Co. , an Atlanta check printer , to its 500-stock index , effective at the close of trading on Wednesday .

Largely to meet tougher new capital requirements , thrifts reduced their assets $ 13.4 billion in August , by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans .
As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio , as required under the new law passed in August , they must also reduce liabilities , such as deposits .
It was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets , the Office of Thrift Supervision said .
`` The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant in Alexandria , Va .
James Barth , an economist with the Office of Thrift Supervision , also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors .
`` That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry . ''
For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August , assets declined by $ 3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 1.2 billion .
As of Aug. 31 , thrifts held $ 185 billion in mortgage-backed securities .
Deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future , as the industry continues to shrink .
For the first eight months of 1989 , thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ 44.5 billion .
The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth .
If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP .
In the early 1980s , I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade .
There has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981 .
The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period , but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated .
This bias is in no way deliberate .
The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates -LRB- mainly employment or hours -RRB- instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data .
In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees , it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7 % during the 1980s .
The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well .
Because finance and services contribute 10 % to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15 % a year .
I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product .
In 1985 , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed .
In sum , the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP .
In other words , the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about 20 % .

Net was $ 139 million , or 98 cents a share , for the quarter , compared with $ 213 million , or $ 1.56 a share , a year ago .
Carbide , like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry , was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter .
`` It certainly was n't a disaster , but it does show weakness '' in some of the company 's chief markets , said George Krug , a chemicals-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co .
Prices for polyethylene , a common plastic and an important Carbide product , started to fall early this year ; the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories .
Some producers of polyethylene , figuring the inventory reductions are near an end , have announced price boosts .
A Carbide spokesman said `` the conditions are right for the increase to hold . ''
Operating profit from carbon products , such as graphite electrodes , also declined , to $ 6 million from $ 20 million .
The latest quarter included a gain of about $ 62 million on the sale of the company 's urethane polyols and propylene glycols businesses .
That gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ 55 million from a write-down in its polysilicon business .
For the nine months , net totaled $ 526 million , or $ 3.74 a share , up 5 % from $ 501 million , or $ 3.71 a share , a year ago .
At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders .
Up to now , Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico .
These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon .
Officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel .
Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $ 650 million in penalties .
Ohio , the District of Columbia , Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions .
It already has sold its retail , or individual-investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking .
Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort , led by government-approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen , to settle its legal problems with the states .
`` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said Susan Bryant , Oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel .
While Ms. Bryant 's state went ahead and accepted Drexel 's settlement offer of $ 25,000 , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions .
Similarly , Alfred Rubega , New Hampshire 's director of securities regulation , said his state had n't received any complaints about Drexel , so it really could n't press the issue .
Mr. Cohen , the Drexel general counsel , said , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by the end of the day ' we 'll be losing any licenses . ''
Mr. Cohen said more than $ 2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ 11.5 million .
`` The rate we 're going , I think that by the end of the month , we 're looking to have a total of 30 to 35 , '' he said .
The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry .
There are , according to several securities commissioners , at least 16 states that are either close to settlements with Drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling .
New Jersey , for example , was asked to accept $ 300,000 , but refused .
The state can also bar Drexel as an investment adviser .
Connecticut already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke Drexel 's brokerage license .
`` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said .
Particularly touchy are the cases of New York , which is Drexel 's base , and California , the base of Drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties .
But Drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials .
Still , she said , Drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing .
`` We need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again . ''
Time Warner Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ 176 million , or $ 2.88 cents a share , reflecting acquisition costs for a 59.3 % stake in Warner Communications Inc. and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction .
Time Warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining Warner shares .
On a pro-forma basis , assuming the merger was effective Jan 1 , 1988 , including the results from both Time Inc. and all of Warner , that cash flow figure would be $ 526 million for the latest quarter , more than double the comparable figure a year ago , or $ 242 million , according to Time Warner .
`` What really matters is the operating income of the divisions : I look at these numbers and I say , these businesses are doing well , '' said Mark Manson , a vice president of Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
That 's a big number .
In the year-ago third quarter , Time on its own reported net income of $ 81 million , or $ 1.42 a share .
On a pro forma basis , including all of Warner 's earnings , Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $ 217 million , compared with a $ 342 million loss a year earlier .
For the third quarter , Warner 's $ 106 million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $ 113 million , or 90 cents a share .
The 1988 figures were restated to include the results of Lorimar Telepictures Corp. , which Warner acquired in January .
`` Batman '' alone has racked up more than $ 247 million in box-office receipts to date , making it Warner Bros . ' largest grossing film ever .
Warner also contributed record results from its music business , where unit sales of compact discs rose more than 50 % from a year ago , the company said , helped by Prince 's `` Batman '' soundtrack .
In addition , the 1988 results included a $ 20 million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at American Television & Communications Corp .
In magazines , higher advertising revenues at Sports Illustrated and Fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Time Warner closed at $ 138.625 a share , up $ 1.875 , while Warner closed at $ 63.875 a share , up 12.5 cents .
William S. Leavitt , chairman , said Mr. Penn , 58 years old , would continue as a consultant and would work with the board in selecting a successor .
The company said it would have no further comment .
His father , David S. Leavitt , was chairman and chief executive until his death in an accident five years ago , at which time Mr. Penn was named president .
Four Democrats on the House Banking Committee sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of James Simmons , an Arizona banker and former fund-raiser for Mr. Bush , to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp .
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp are members of the board .
An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons , the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix , is the Republican appointee , and that a security clearance was under way .
Mr. Simmons declined to comment , and the White House said the congressmen 's letter is under review .
Both banks have been battered , as have other Arizona banks , by falling real estate prices .
`` We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your thorough consideration before making this key RTC appointment , '' the letter said .
But Mr. Simmons has long ties to both Republicans and banking .
The two met more than 30 years ago , when Mr. Simmons worked for Commercial Bank & Trust Co. of Midland , Texas , where Mr. Bush was an organizing director .
That committee determined to open Arizona to banking across state lines .
The letter to Mr. Bush was signed by Reps. Bruce Vento -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , the chairman of the Banking Committee 's RTC Task Force , Thomas McMillen -LRB- D. , Md. -RRB- , Kweisi Mfume -LRB- D. , Md . -RRB- and Paul Kanjorski -LRB- D. , Pa . -RRB- .
Mr. McElroy , 54 years old , will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit .
Mr. Werner , 58 , was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit .
The debt-rating concern cited the bank 's move into the Texas market , noting its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance .
Officials at the New York bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the debt-rating changes .
Visitors are ushered into the premises by red-frocked doormen known as waiters , a reminder of the insurance market 's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century London .
Lloyd 's , once a pillar of the world insurance market , is being shaken to its very foundation .
At the same time , Lloyd 's is besieged by disgruntled investors and hamstrung by inefficient but time-honored ways of conducting business .
`` Lloyd 's is on the ropes , '' says Peter Nutting , a Lloyd 's investor for 17 years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence .
It needs to sort itself out . ''
Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year , more than triple the number of resignations in 1987 .
Lackluster returns are one reason .
In 1985 , it was 2.1 % .
Many of the 31,329 investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic tenets , the concept of unlimited personal liability .
And catastrophes are getting ever more costly .
During the five-year period ended 1986 , roughly 80 % of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates , according to Chatset consultants .
`` I have wished I could die and be out of it -- that 's how bad it is , '' Betty Atkins , a secretary from suburban London , says .
Ms. Atkins , who underwrote # 20,000 , or about $ 32,000 , of insurance coverage on that syndicate , now faces potential losses of roughly # 70,000 , or $ 111,000 .
Unease is widespread among exchange members .
The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ''
Meanwhile , competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying .
Over the past decade , competitors have chipped away at the exchange 's share of the # 2.5 billion marine market in London , where half the world 's ships are insured .
The official asked not to be named . -RRB-
Lloyd 's has endured decades of genteel decline .
It virtually dictated how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe .
Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included . -RRB-
Though Lloyd 's pioneered such now-standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance , competitors now underwrite most of that business .
Even Lloyd 's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged .
But since 1981 , Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington , Ky. has grabbed a 20 % stake of the market .
Thus , he asserts , Lloyd 's ca n't react quickly to competition .
They are n't controlling their destiny like they used to . ''
`` This is a watershed time , and we are trying to plot our way ahead , '' he says .
Lloyd 's , he says , is cut off from `` the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a steadying influence '' against catastrophic losses .
The exchange , he says , must find new products and new markets .
Tradition is dictator at Lloyd 's .
Some exchange wags call the building `` the oil rig . '' -RRB-
The Lloyd 's market actively underwrites insurance just 4 hours a day , brokers say .
A two-hour lunch break follows .
Lloyd 's vast trading hall houses a warren of well-polished desks .
Sandwiched between desks , underwriters sit on benches surrounded by stacks of policies .
A broker may have to approach as many as 20 underwriters who insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates .
`` The system , '' says Nicholas Samengo-Turner , a Lloyd 's broker who left the exchange in 1985 , `` is so ludicrously unprofessional it drives you mad . ''
John Wetherell , a Lloyd 's underwriter , says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50 % the premiums they should have charged for property risks from 1980 to 1985 .
Lloyd 's officials decline to comment on the matter .
Many at Lloyd 's expect the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further .
The magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims .
That year , it posted record pretax profit of # 650 million , a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims .
Insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be aggravated by more than $ 600 million in aviation losses -LRB- including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie , Scotland -RRB- and a still-uncalculated chunk of claims from September 's Hurricane Hugo .
Mr. Lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names .
It recently cut its work force by 9 % , or 213 . -RRB-
Mr. Wetherell , the underwriter , reckons half of his business could be transacted by computer , cutting costs at least 10 % .
Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to centralize price and policy information .
Lloyd 's overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts to update marketing strategies .
Lloyd 's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada .
The proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand .
Mr. Lawrence says the exchange is updating some procedures to make speedier payments on claims .
Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co. named Masahiro Dozen president .
Yoshitoki Chino retains his title of chairman of Daiwa , Japan 's second-largest securities firm .
The title of chief executive officer is n't used .
It was only earlier this year that the jovial , easygoing executive -- he likes to joke with Americans about how his name is synonymous with twelve -- was appointed deputy president .
Daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms .
For the six months ended Sept. 30 , Daiwa reported unconsolidated -LRB- parent company -RRB- net income of 79.03 billion yen -LRB- $ 556.5 million -RRB- on revenue of 332.38 billion yen -LRB- $ 2.34 billion -RRB- .
Several observers interpreted Mr. Dozen 's appointment as an attempt by Daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of Japan 's domestic markets , which should mean increased competition .
While they have moved to the fore in underwriting fixed-income securities in the Eurobond market -- mostly for Japanese firms -- they have been only marginally profitable , if at all , in the U.S .
And while the Japanese have stepped up their purchases of U.S. shares in the past several months , they have shown themselves in the past to be fickle investors .
Mr. Dozen knows these problems firsthand .
`` He made desperate efforts , using the yellow pages from beginning to end , '' said Koji Yoneyama , president of Daiwa 's U.S. unit .
By his own account , Mr. Dozen did n't do much better with U.S. bonds .
But he could n't sell any .
Maybe it 's crazy , '' he said .
Upon returning to New York , `` Exhausted , I got into a taxicab , and the woman driver said : ` Americans make better fishermen , ' '' he recalled .
He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures , options , mortgaged-backed securities , computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions .
Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959 .
In his climb to the top , Mr. Dozen also headed the company 's stock-exchange division , its fixed-income units and its international operations .
But it Mr. Dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales force -- to accede to the presidency .
And anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force `` would be fragile , '' said a Daiwa executive .
`` He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball , like a farmer , '' said Mr. Yoneyama .
The nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 20 cents and said it may buy back as much as 4.8 % of its common outstanding .
Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend .
Some analysts said Inco , which had cash reserves of $ 272 million as of Sept. 30 , could still announce a special dividend in the next few months , though it would be smaller than the $ 10-a-share special dividend it paid last year .
Inco 's net fell to $ 129.3 million , or $ 1.23 a share , in the third quarter from $ 200.3 million , or $ 1.88 a share , a year earlier .
Excluding special gains from tax-loss carry-forwards , earnings in the latest quarter were $ 117.7 million , or $ 1.12 a share , compared with $ 187.4 million , or $ 1.76 a share .
Inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next 12 months if nickel market conditions are favorable .
UAL Corp. 's board quashed any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out , saying United Airlines ' parent should remain independent for now .
The two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of unresolved matters , including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility .
Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC , the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid , withdrew its support .
UAL , which had risen $ 9.875 to $ 178.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group , reversed course and plummeted in off-exchange trading after the 5:09 p.m. EDT announcement .
The rebound in UAL stock during regular trading hours Monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price 41 % below its level before Oct. 13 , the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal .
But the board said it was n't interested for now .
The buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan .
The directors signaled , however , that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value , saying they would continue to explore `` all strategic and financial alternatives . ''
The board said it concluded that `` the welfare of the company , its shareholders , its employees and the broader public... can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong , viable , independent company . ''
He also vowed to `` make every effort to nurture... a constructive new relationship that has been forged with participating employee groups . ''
Labor problems top the list .
In return for an ownership stake in the company , the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted .
As a `` good-will measure , '' the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL 's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft .
The union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort `` still need to be addressed . ''
The machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction .
The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out .
His credibility is also on the line in the investment community .
But he and his chief financial officer , John Pope , sowed some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates , while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ 114.3 million they stood to gain from sale of their UAL stock and options .
It also inevitably leaves a residue of shareholder lawsuits .
One takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote .
Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , whose $ 240-a-share offer for UAL in August triggered a bidding war , says he remains interested in the airline .
Essentially , he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ 300 a share .
Tandy 's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories .
Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development .
Those chips were in dire shortage last year , hurting many U.S. computer companies that could n't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips .
`` At this time , we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need -LCB- for DRAMs -RCB- from the market as a rule , '' said Ed Juge , Tandy 's director of market planning .
`` I would like to have had them , '' he said .
Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June , when the group was formed by seven electronics companies : Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Digital Equipment Corp. ; Hewlett-Packard Co. ; Intel Corp. ; International Business Machines Corp. ; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp .
U.S. Memories needs a catalyst , he said , to inspire others to join .
Sun Microsystems Inc. said it 's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week .
Personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. said it is still studying the situation .
In a startling turnabout , Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them .
With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , the leakers are performing a public service .
What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry .
But there 's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue .
The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega .
The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity .
For example , what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations ?
Mr. Noriega did n't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol .
Or maybe a Surgeon General 's warning : Confiding in the United States may be fatal .
The CIA 's Deputy Director of Operations , Richard Stoltz , tried to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster 's point .
In other words , Congress wo n't let the CIA do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with the CIA .
And of course , doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties .
The Intelligence Committee 's ranking Republican , Senator William Cohen , joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra , deploring `` Men of Zeal . ''
What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail ?
The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set , a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action .
There are of course good reasons the U.S. should n't get into the assassination business , but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars .
In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility .
As it now stands , the U.S. can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi .
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him .
Mr. Katz happily agreed , sliding over the fact that California 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes .
Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch .
There were no immediate reports of deaths , but officials said a number of workers were still unaccounted for last night .
One local Phillips manager said a seal blew in one of the plant 's reactors .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Phillips Petroleum shares fell $ 1.125 to $ 23.125 .
The U.S. Coast Guard closed six miles of the Houston Ship Channel , where about 150 companies have operations , because the thick , black smoke obscured the area .
Broken water lines and gas leaks hindered firefighters ' efforts , but by late yesterday authorities said they had the fire under control .
The initial fireball was caught by cameras in downtown Houston , about 10 miles away .
The injured , including three in critical condition , were treated for burns , breathing problems and cuts from flying glass , hospital officials said .
The number working at the time of the blast was n't known .
In late August , four contract workers were injured and one Phillips employee died after an explosion at a fuel supply line near the facility 's boiler house .
Plastics are the cornerstone of Phillips ' chemicals operations , which is the biggest single contributor to the company 's profits .
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier said it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted under the civil racketeering law .
In the suit , filed in June 1988 , the government accused the union 's leadership of depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering .
U.S. District Judge David Edelstein also permanently enjoined Mr. Lombardo from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union .
Exxon Corp. said its third-quarter earnings slipped 9 % as profits from two of its three major businesses sagged .
Phillips Petroleum Co. and Atlantic Richfield Co. also reported declines in quarterly profit , while Ashland Oil Inc. posted a loss for the latest quarter .
Although Exxon spent heavily during the latest quarter to clean up the Alaskan shoreline blackened by its huge oil spill , those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing spill-related program are covered by $ 880 million in charges taken during the first half .
She added , however , that charges already taken do n't take into account the potential effect of litigation involving the oil spill .
Exxon 's net income during the third quarter dropped to $ 1.11 billion , or 87 cents a share , from $ 1.22 billion , or 93 cents a share , a year earlier .
During the third quarter , Exxon purchased 8.34 million shares of its stock at a cost of $ 373 million .
Exxon 's earnings from chemicals operations fell $ 90 million , to $ 254 million , while refining and marketing profits declined $ 180 million , to $ 357 million .
He estimates that the price of West Texas Intermediate , the U.S. benchmark crude , was $ 4.04 a barrel higher during the third quarter of this year than in the same period last year .
A year earlier , the refiner earned $ 66 million , or $ 1.19 a share .
For the year , net income tumbled 61 % to $ 86 million , or $ 1.55 a share .
In September , Ashland settled the long-simmering dispute by agreeing to pay Iran $ 325 million .
The oil refiner also booked a $ 15 million charge for selling Ashland Technology Corp. , one of its subsidiaries , at a loss .
Revenue climbed 28 % , to $ 1.18 billion from $ 925 million .
Refining and marketing earnings climbed to $ 33.3 million from $ 12.9 million , and exploration and production earnings rose to $ 37.1 million from $ 17.9 million .
It is widely known within industry circles that Hess had to buy oil products in the high-priced spot markets to continue supplying its customers .
Phillips Petroleum 's third-quarter earnings slid 60 % , to $ 87 million , or 36 cents a share , from $ 215 million , or 89 cents a share .
Shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline , said Chairman C.J. Silas in a statement .
A year ago , results were buoyed by a $ 20 million after-tax gain from an asset sale .
The latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $ 71 million from non-recurring items .
The latest period included a $ 54 million gain from the sale of various oil and gas properties , a $ 22 million charge from the restructuring of Occidental 's domestic oil and gas operations , and tax credits of $ 42 million .
Occidental said oil and gas earnings fell to $ 17 million from $ 20 million .
Chemical earnings fell 10 % , reflecting softening of demand .
Sales fell 20 % , to $ 3.7 billion from $ 4.6 billion .
Offsetting the lower stake in Lyondell were higher crude oil prices , increased natural gas volumes and higher coke prices , the company said .
For the nine months , Arco reported net income of $ 1.6 billion , or $ 8.87 a share , up 33 % from $ 1.2 billion or $ 6.56 a share a year earlier .

He suggested that investors buy the shares of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea , J. Baker , McDonald 's , Philip Morris and Sara Lee .
McDonald 's has long-term debt equaling 91 % of shareholder equity currently , but Mr. Kerschner said the company is carrying real estate assets at about $ 2.6 billion below their real value .

Who 'd have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents ?
At his old job in Compton , Calif. , he took a bitter teachers ' strike and nearly came to blows with a school-board member .
In New York City , the new Chancellor , Joseph Fernandez , has landed like a 16-inch shell in the middle of a system that has been impervious to serious reform .
Former Patterson , N.J. , principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public 's first experience with this new breed of no-nonsense administrator .
He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline , but is n't it interesting that some of the country 's biggest , most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel-chewing mold ?
Mr. Fernandez does n't take control in New York until January , but already he 's roiling the waters .
It means it is virtually impossible to fire or even transfer incompetent principals .
One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years , despite a serious drinking problem and rarely showing up for work .
Naturally , the principals ' union loves building tenure , and tenure has withstood previous challenge .
In his old job , as Dade County chief , Mr. Fernandez forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals .
But the no-more-nonsense superintendents are going to have to be judicious as well ; incompetent principals and administrators should go , but the good ones ought to be left alone .
He takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform .
This of course led to disaster in New York City .
The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems .
The classroom itself operated on the periphery of this awful system , discipline collapsed , and kids stopped learning .
Until then , it 's clear that some of the people who 've been keeping big-city schools down are going to be dealing with the Terminator .
As part of the agreement , Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson 's 66 newspapers , ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently .
Under the terms of the accord , Ingersoll will pay about $ 255 million for the Register , a daily that Goodson bought for about $ 170 million in 1986 .
Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll to run the Goodson papers .
Goodson , which is based here , will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $ 155 million in 1987 .
Industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high , causing a strain on Goodson 's finances .
David N. Hurwitz , president and chief operating officer of Goodson , said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers .
The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll .
But in recent years , Mr. Ingersoll began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg , Pincus & Co .
The company said its revenue will exceed $ 750 million this year .
Mr. Goodson , in his own statement , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over the past few years , it has become increasingly clear that Ralph and I have different agendas , '' and that he feels `` more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the Goodson papers .
Mr. Roman , 59 years old , abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency , whose largest client is American Express , to become American Express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications .
Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year to take `` executive responsibility '' for an embarrassing effort to discredit banker Edmond Safra .
The company later apologized and agreed to make $ 8 million in contributions to charities chosen by him .
Ad industry executives were n't surprised by Mr. Roman 's decision to leave Ogilvy .
And although Mr. Roman and WPP 's chief executive , Martin Sorrell , have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other , people close to Mr. Roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company .
Mr. Roman will be succeeded as the head of Ogilvy 's flagship ad agency , Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide , by Graham Phillips , 50 , who had been president of North American operations and who , like Mr. Sorrell , is British .
He had been president of the international operations .
Mr. Roman appears custom-made for the American Express job .
Moreover , after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for being squeaky-clean and a straight arrow -- which can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident .
Aside from working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years , Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson .
But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation , saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay , offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine -LRB- The wine , naturally , was Seagram 's brand , an Ogilvy client -RRB- .
The implication that I was pushed aside would n't be accurate , '' Mr. Roman said .
Mr. Roman said American Express 's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September .
Although it ultimately was n't offered to him , he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters .
It was my decision , not anyone else 's . ''
The two executives could hardly be more different .
During time off , Mr. Roman tends to his garden ; Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for , among other things , fast cars and planes .
I 'm the guy who made him head of New York , head of the U.S. , president of North America , and recommended him -LCB- to Mr. Sorrell -RCB- as my successor .
He labeled reports of friction `` ridiculous , '' and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips 's boat in Connecticut .
`` I consider this a second career , '' he said .
Mr. Roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy .
`` General Foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work , and will continue to be , '' said David Hurwitt , a vice president of Kraft General Foods .
`` Ken was my key contact , '' said J. Nicholas Hahn , president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc. , which represents cotton producers .
I have n't seen or talked to him in several years . ''
While the agency has done well in many parts of the world , its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently ; it has won few new accounts while losing big ones , including Maxwell House .
I think they need creative leadership , and I do n't think they have it , '' said Emma Hill , an analyst with Wertheim & Co .
`` Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company , and nobody has filled that void , '' said Ms. Hill .
`` Graham Phillips has been there a long time , knows the culture well , is aggressive , and apparently gets along well with '' Mr. Sorrell , said Andrew Wallach , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert .
Hopefully , he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in New York . ''
Computer Sciences Corp. , El Segundo , Calif. , said it is close to making final an agreement to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates from Saatchi & Saatchi

The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting 's Turner Network Television channel , or TNT , and then will be released internationally in movie theaters .
Ted Turner , Turner Broadcasting 's chairman , was named chairman of Turner Pictures , and Gerry Hogan , president of Turner Entertainment Networks , was named president of the unit .
But he said Turner Broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the U.S .
Turner has made several movies , docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years , but the company has never acted as a full-fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters .
The Turner move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films .
In a sign the stock slump has n't quieted Europe 's takeover fever , Cie . Financiere de Paribas said it intends to bid for one of France 's other large financial and industrial holding companies , Cie. de Navigation Mixte .
Its cash-or-shares bid values Navigation Mixte at about 22.82 billion francs -LRB- $ 3.62 billion -RRB- , making this one of France 's largest-ever attempted takeovers .
The move would greatly boost Paribas 's stake in the insurance , transport and food businesses , where Navigation Mixte is strong .
Allianz holds a 50 % stake in Navigation Mixte 's insurance interests , acquired three weeks ago .
Long considered a potential takeover target , Navigation Mixte had hoped Allianz would help protect it from raiders .
Paribas is Allianz 's main French bank , and the Munich-based group said it intends to stay neutral .
But Navigation Mixte is loosely held and hard to defend .
Who would bid against Paribas ? ''
Last month , Paribas 's archrival , Cie . Financiere de Suez , won a battle for Groupe Victoire , France 's second-largest private-sector insurer , which itself had just acquired West Germany 's Colonia Versicherung AG .
Moreover , Suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of Societe Generale de Belgique .
Although Paribas denies it , analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between France 's two largest investment banking groups .
Although Paribas Chairman Michel Francois-Poncet would n't rule out eventually selling all of Navigation Mixte 's insurance operations to Allianz , he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate .
Navigation Mixte has investments in a sugar company , a food and canning concern , a bakery and bus and trucking firms , among others .
Payment by Allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the French concern 's treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs .
Alternatively , it said it would offer three Paribas shares , themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1 , for one Navigation Mixte share .
Paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it .
Some financial sources said privately that Paribas blundered in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group , bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price .
When notoriously independent-minded Navigation Mixte Chairman Marc Fournier rejected Paribas 's offer and began buying Paribas shares in retaliation , Mr. Francois-Poncet said , he felt obliged to bid for control .
A bid against Paribas could n't be ruled out .
Analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover , however , and its officials could n't be reached .
In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell 39 cents a barrel to $ 19.76 for December delivery .
Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day , with some accounts putting the 13-nation group 's output as high as 23 million barrels a day .
But because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market participants say , OPEC production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further .
With prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices .
The Phillips plant makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products .
Dozens of workers were injured , authorities said .
Some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices .
`` Our technician is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ 20 , '' he said .
The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $ 1.1960 .
The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ 1.23-a-pound level , selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers -- anticipating further declines -- moved in .
According to Bernard Savaiko , senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber , the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts .
Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar , which would normally support the U.S. copper market .
`` The sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong , '' he said .
Mr. Savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $ 1.04 .
January platinum closed down $ 2.80 an ounce at $ 486.30 , nearly $ 4 above its low for the day .
Platinum is believed to have good support around $ 480 and palladium at around $ 130 .
Such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile catalytic converters .
He said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again .
Many analysts believe that the Soviets ' thirst for dollars this year to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much .
On the Chicago Board of Trade , soybeans for November delivery closed at $ 5.63 a bushel , down half a cent , while the December wheat contract rose three-quarters of a cent to $ 4.0775 a bushel .
But acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt .
SUGAR : World prices tumbled , mostly from their own weight , according to analysts .
For the past week or so , traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan .
Developing countries such as India , some analysts said , seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range , around 14.75 cents , and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range , around 13.50 cents .
A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country .
The December contract rose $ 33 a metric ton to $ 1,027 , near its high for the day .
Market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns , which in the past have preceded sharp rallies .
At such prices , according to Mr. Savaiko , bargain hunting and short-covering -- buying back of contracts previously sold -- by speculators is n't uncommon .
He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move .
Rockwell International Corp. bought out Ikegai Corp. 's interest in Ikegai-Goss , a joint venture of the two companies based in Tokyo .
The agreement provides that Ikegai Corp. will remain a supplier to Ikegai-Goss , which makes printing presses for the newspaper industry .
Ikegai-Goss , which has about 200 employees , is among the industry leaders in keyless inking technology , which reduces time and materials waste when preparing a press for printing .
Early in the day , bonds rose modestly on economists ' forecasts that this week 's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed for trouble .
For example , today the Department of Commerce is scheduled to release the September durable goods report .
That would follow a 3.9 % advance in August .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 .

In more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk bonds , a $ 150 million issue by Imo Industries Inc. was snapped up by investors while underwriters for Beatrice Co. 's $ 350 million issue are considering restructuring the deal to attract buyers .
`` On the negative side , the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market , '' said William M. Brachfeld , economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc .
We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' he said .
Tomorrow , Resolution Funding Corp. , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts , will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
Analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction .
The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history .
The issue yields 8.90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from the company .
The issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year Treasurys .
Treasury bonds were to point higher yesterday in light trading .
The latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 to yield 7.90 % , compared with 100 to yield 7.97 % .
Short-term rates rose yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction , compared with the previous bill sale .
The $ 7.81 billion of six-month Treasury bills were sold with an average discount rate of 7.50 % , the highest since the average of 7.60 % at the Oct. 10 auction .
Here are auction details : Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
The 13-week bills mature Jan. 25 , 1990 , and the 26-week bills mature April 26 , 1990 .
In the junk bond market , Imo Industries ' issue of 12-year debentures , considered to be one of the market 's high-quality credits , was priced at par to yield 12 % .
`` It 's a segmented market , and if you have a good , strong credit , people have an appetite for it , '' he said .
In light of the recent skittishness in the high-yield market , junk bond analysts and traders expect other high-yield deals to be sweetened or restructured before they are offered to investors .
Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering , the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys .
Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced at a yield of between 13 % and 13 % .
The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $ 1.2 billion of Remic securities in three issues , and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $ 250 million Remic backed by 9 % 15-year securities .
Traders said thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks .
Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 , up ; and Freddie Mac 9 % securities were at 97 , up .
A $ 575 million San Antonio , Texas , electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector .
But alleviating that overhang failed to stimulate much activity in the secondary market , where prices were off to up point .
He attributed that to the issue 's aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace .
A $ 137.6 million Maryland Stadium Authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared to be off to a good start .
Activity quieted in the New York City bond market , where heavy investor selling last week drove yields on the issuer 's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point .
The turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about Japan 's bond market .
The yield rose to 5.38 % .
The benchmark 7 % bond due October 1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.80 to yield 7.03 % , while the 6 % notes due July 1994 fell 0.10 to 97.65 to yield 7.34 % .
The benchmark 11 % Treasury bond due rose to 111 to yield 10.11 % , while the 12 % issue of 1995 rose to 103 to yield 11.01 % .

Deer , wild hog , armadillos and alligators are the glamour quadrupeds and the birds are innumerable , especially the herons and the spoonbills .

At age eight , Josephine Baker was sent by her mother to a white woman 's house to do chores in exchange for meals and a place to sleep -- a place in the basement with the coal .
It is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas .
And , for Ms. Baker , the ride was far from over .
Bricktop , another American black woman who found a measure of fame in Paris , said : `` I do n't think I 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life was more complicated than Josephine 's . ''
Baker had lots of them .
As she saw one key love affair , the problem was n't her infidelity , it was his jealousy .
She adopted 12 of assorted races , naming them the Rainbow Tribe , and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina .
Friends pitched in .
Another lifelong complication , as Phyllis Rose makes clear in `` Jazz Cleopatra : Josephine Baker in Her Time '' -LRB- Doubleday , 321 pages , $ 22.50 -RRB- , was racism .
African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age to be inspired by blacks .
Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater , where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line -LRB- performing of course for all-white audiences -RRB- .
`` She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her , '' sniffed the literary world 's Maria Jolas , not entirely inaccurately .
Ms. Rose , who teaches literature at Wesleyan University , quickly proceeds to overemphasize , claiming that Baker 's dancing `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous .
It is easy to see why Baker , a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women , attracts Ms. Rose , the author of `` Parallel Lives , '' a wonderful study of Victorian marriage .
Baker 's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term .
Baker was 68 years old when she died in Paris , two days after the sold-out opening of her newest show : a movie-like ending to what was a cinematic life .
During World War II , her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted , a decision made by only about 2 % of French citizens .
In Humphrey Bogart 's nightclub , Victor Laszlo leads Free French sympathizers in `` La Marseillaise '' to drown out the Nazis .
The Free French wore black arm bands , and when she sang `` J'ai J'ai deux amours '' they wept .
In her introduction , Ms. Rose writes that she feels she has much in common with Baker , but as `` Jazz Cleopatra '' goes on , it seems more rushed , as though the author were growing less interested .
One chapter opens : `` World War II was not one of France 's glorious moments . ''
One devoted fan who fell under Baker 's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond .
The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read , but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help explain why Ernest Hemingway called Baker `` The most sensational woman anybody ever saw .

Heady stuff it 's not .
The Denver-based concern , which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year , is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust .
When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash .
Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market .
If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail .
The trust is n't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its Manville stock .
Its cash and liquid securities fell by $ 338 million in the first six months of 1989 .
And , beginning in 1992 , it will have a claim on as much as 20 % of Manville 's annual net income .
As of June 30 , it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims , for an average of $ 40,424 each .
And as of midyear , settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ 136 million -- more than half the trust 's total of $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities .
Even before then , the trust may be eager to unload Manville stock .
Moreover , with 88 % of its assets tied up in Manville , the trust is badly in need of diversification .
Manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring .
We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says .
But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 .
Thus , analysts say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville 's other shareholders .
Even if there is no restructuring , Manville seems to be attractive long-term .

For bankers and regulators , Arizona is looking more like Texas every day .
First Interstate said the unit , bludgeoned by Arizona 's worsening real-estate woes , will have a $ 174 million loss for the quarter .
It charged off an estimated $ 200 million of Arizona loans , leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ 255 million , about 61 % of its $ 416 million of troubled loans and repossessed real estate .
The action capped a spurt of grim Arizona banking news for the third quarter , and emphatically signaled that Arizona is challenging Texas 's long reign as banking 's busiest graveyard .
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. , which has been wrangling with regulators for months over what to do about Pinnacle 's moribund Merabank thrift unit , suspended its dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income .
New York-based Chase Manhattan Corp. took an $ 85 million Arizona-related charge .
Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had been combing through First Interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month ; they first recommended that First Interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $ 350 million third-quarter hit .
`` At that point , -LCB- First Interstate -RCB- decided it was the better part of valor not to negotiate further , '' said one industry official close to the talks .
He said the provision `` was n't forced upon us , but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number . ''
At least six of Arizona 's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent ; they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses .
It had a $ 258.9 million loss in the second quarter .
It also had $ 479.7 million of past-due loans ; its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available , though it is believed to be small .
Together , the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent Arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $ 1.5 billion , foreclosed property of $ 1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $ 1.63 billion .
The thrifts had a combined loss of $ 487.8 million in the second quarter .
All this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in Arizona 's boom-and-bust history , compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles : greed , fraud and plain bad banking .
Now , annual population growth is running at about 2 % a year , some desert tracts bought three years ago for $ 90,000 an acre are being sold at $ 25,000 an acre and Phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office space .
Many Arizona real-estate experts think the worst may be yet to come .
That 's up from about 687 a month in 1985 , and it 's accelerating : So far this month , foreclosures are averaging about 85 a day .
Moreover , Mr. Shattuck and others said residential real estate , which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn , is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures .
`` It 's reasonable to say there is not a solvent S&L in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low , '' said Mr. Jackson .
The only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is : ` Pay me in 60 days . ' ''
For the six months ended June 30 , it reported net income of $ 234.3 million , or $ 4.83 a share , including $ 46 million from tax credits and accounting changes .
Mr. Marrie said the bank expects Arizona real-estate prices , which plummeted 40 % over the last year , to fall another 20 % before stabilizing .
First Interstate said its operations outside of Arizona `` achieved results as expected for the quarter , '' but did n't specify the results .
Since its unsuccessful bid for BankAmerica Corp. in 1986 , the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance , but many industry officials believe it may be ripe for a takeover bid , especially with interstate banking set to begin in California in 1991 .
Separately , Standard & Poor 's Corp. lowered its ratings on Valley National Corp. 's senior debt to double-B from double-B-plus , affecting about $ 300 million of long-term debt .

Conner Peripherals Inc. , which has a near-monopoly on a key part used in many portable computers , is on target to surpass Compaq Computer Corp. as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in U.S. business history .
It said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared 72 % to $ 11.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 6.8 million , or 19 cents a share , in the year-ago period .
For the nine months , the San Jose , Calif.-based company said net income jumped 84 % to $ 26.9 million , or 69 cents a share , from $ 14.6 million , or 43 cents a share .
Analysts expect Conner 's earnings to reach roughly $ 40 million , or $ 1 to $ 1.05 a share , on sales of $ 650 million , for 1989 , the company 's third full year in business .
But Compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up .
Since its inception , Conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines .
The company supplies drives to Compaq and Zenith Data Systems , the top two U.S. manufacturers of laptops , and to Toshiba Corp. , NEC Corp. and Sharp Corp. , the leading Japanese laptop makers .
In the coming months , however , this is likely to change .
And the Japanese are likely to keep close on Conner 's heels .
Both Toshiba and NEC already produce hard-disk drives , and Sony also is studying the field , Mr. Claridge said .
Yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks .
`` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our -LRB- older -RRB- products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name .
These new products could account for as much as 35 % of the company 's business in 1990 , Mr. Conner estimated .
Conner already is shipping its new drives .
Conner is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine , which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase .
The availability of these drives , in turn , boosted demand for laptop computers , whose usefulness had been limited because of lack of storage .
Sales to Compaq represented 26 % of Conner 's business in its third quarter , compared with 42 % in the year-ago period .
A Newport Beach law firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service , called Telelawyer , using MCI Communication Corp. 's toll-tele-phone service .
Though the service is available only in California , Telelawyer founder Michael Cane says he plans to franchise it in other states .
Mr. Cane stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep .
We have no in-office business . ''
Local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law .
When a caller reaches Telelawyer by dialing 900-TELELAW , a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys .
There is no charge for research -- only for time on the phone .
But he says Cane & Associates does n't receive referral fees .
The firm is getting about 50 calls a day , and the average call lasts about 15 minutes .
JURY CONVICTS congressman in connection with Wedtech Corp. scandal .
The jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $ 20,000 , interest-free loan from a Wedtech officer .
Wedtech , which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise , formerly was a minority-owned South Bronx , N.Y. , defense contractor .
Mr. Little said more than 20 people have been convicted in the Wedtech cases , including former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- .
Mr. Garcia , who represents New York 's 18th congressional district , which includes the Bronx , said he has n't decided whether he will resign .

Hutton Ingram will have a general corporate , securities , real-estate and litigation practice , and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community .
While investigations into lawyer misconduct will remain secret , the public will be notified once a formal complaint is filed against an attorney .
In addition , Illinois attorneys will lose the right to sue clients who file malicious complaints against them .
Illinois joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public , according to the American Bar Association .
In addition , he says , publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation .
`` There 's no constitutional right involved in the rule change , '' he says .

Executives close to Philip Morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc. , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account .
Both Philip Morris and Backer Spielvogel declined to comment .
Also mentioned as a contender was TBWA Advertising , but the company denied it was participating .
Benson & Hedges has been one of its most high-visibility campaigns , as well as one of its largest clients .
But Philip Morris has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year , industry executives said , and it now bills about $ 30 million to $ 40 million .
According to John Maxwell , an analyst at Wheat First Securities , Richmond , Va. , Benson & Hedges has slipped from 4.7 % of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1 % after the second quarter of this year .
The slip has come despite high-profile ads created by Wells Rich , including one picturing a young man clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch .
Wells Rich first popularized the Benson & Hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying , among other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette .
Philip Morris , trying to revive the Benson & Hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986 .
Kenneth Olshan , Wells Rich 's chairman , did n't return phone calls seeking comment .

`` Other cities are calling -LCB- groups booked here for tours and conferences -RCB- and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , '' said Scott Shafer , a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos .
The other five Bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $ 2.8 billion .
Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in San Francisco that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage .
Until it was closed Tuesday , it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the Financial District .
As part of the quake recovery effort , the city Building Department has surveyed about 3,000 buildings , including all of the Financial District 's high-rises .
While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural damage .
In England , Martin Leach , a spokesman for Lloyd 's of London , said the insurance market has n't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster .
On Friday , during a visit to California to survey quake damage , President Bush promised to `` meet the federal government 's obligation '' to assist relief efforts .
The state has a $ 1 billion reserve , and is expected to add $ 1 billion to that fund in the next year .
However , state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum .
Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd. posted a loss for fiscal 1989 of 980.2 million Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 762.4 million -RRB- , the largest in Australian corporate history .
In preliminary , unaudited results reported Friday , Bond Corp. also posted an operating loss of A$ 814.1 million for the year ended June 30 , compared with operating profit of A$ 354.7 million a year earlier .
But the net interest bill jumped 85 % to A$ 686.7 million from A$ 371.1 million .
Much of Bond Corp. 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of Bond Corp. 's assets and those of its units .
However , Bond Corp. said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later .
The company said the general financial performance of its U.S. brewing operations , G. Heileman Brewing Co. , was `` disappointing , and this has been reflected in the results . ''
The staggering losses cap a tumultuous year for Alan Bond and his flagship , Bond Corp .
Now Bond Corp. has agreed to sell at least half its Australian brewing assets .
But in a TV interview Sunday Mr. Bond said , `` We 've taken a big loss .
But we 're out there and we 're going to stay in business .
It said it will look at opportunities in brewing , property and energy resources to the extent consistent with the dominant objective of manageable debt-to-assets ratios .
Some analysts contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater , and Bond Corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is `` uncertainty '' regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm .
Still , the directors said , `` Having fully considered all aspects of the company 's state of affairs and future cash flows , the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent . ''
The Bakersfield Supermarket went out of business last May .
Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan .
The owner was Israel Ortiz , a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two .
The first time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside .
Two weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- Mr. Ortiz was shot three times in the back , during what police classified as a third robbery attempt .
For providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service .
Israel Ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year .
Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers .
Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture .
A survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by Interface , a policy research organization .
The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job .
Crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving .
In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year .
Crime is clearly more deadly to small-scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses .
He found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones .
The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business .
After repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives .
These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls `` crime causing poverty . ''
Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses .
Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime .
The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments .
Since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % .
In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection .
One is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses .
Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves .
Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response they receive .
But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .
For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits .
With National Institute of Justice support , the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols .
While no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks .
Mr. Sherman is a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute in Washington , D.C .
Under the offer , shareholders can purchase one Enfield share at C$ 6.27 for each five shares held .

That 's a fundamental lesson for investors , but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's Friday-the-13th plunge .
That reflects the huge drop a week ago Friday , last Monday 's rebound and the dips and blips that followed .
Funds that invest internationally were the top-performing stock and fixed-income funds .
That means stocks , bonds , money market instruments and real estate . ''
But the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough .
`` It 's like kicking the tires of a car .
General equity funds fell an average of 2.35 % in the week ended Thursday , compared with a 2.32 % slide for the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index .
Gold-oriented funds , for instance , which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal , posted an average decline of 1.15 % .
Global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25 % of their portfolios outside the U.S .
With all that going for them , global flexible portfolio funds declined only 1.07 % in the week through last Thursday .
And Friday the 13th notwithstanding , stocks have been this year 's hot investment .
By comparison , global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19 % , while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17 % .
`` That 's the problem with trying to hedge too much , '' said Mr. Brouwer .
Over the last 20 years , for example , Mr. Brouwer says , an investor putting $ 5,000 a year in the S&P 500 would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in Treasury bills .
The $ 4 million Monetta Fund , for instance , was the seventh top performing fund for the week , with a 2.65 % return .
The fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock appreciates 30 % over its cost .
Last Monday , he started `` buying the high-quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices . ''
The fund 's cash position is now about 22 % , which Mr. Bacarella calls `` still bearish . ''
Howard Stein , chairman of Dreyfus Corp. , said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on Oct. 13 , and about 10 % in cash .
`` We still think there 's a lot of unsettlement in this market .
Many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas , giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak .
Three International Cash Portfolios funds , which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas , were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week .
But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies , as it did for much of this year , the dollar value of these funds declines .
Of the funds that fared the worst in the post-Oct . 13 week , two are heavily invested in airlines stocks , which led the market slide following problems with financing for the UAL Corp . buy-out plan .
The small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign , said A. Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical .
There 's either more to come or an extremely long period of dullness . ''
Several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th .
`` There certainly has n't been a panic reaction , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates .

Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance PLC , a major British composite insurer , said it is taking a stake in Nationwide Anglia Building Society 's estate agency business as part of a plan to create a range of commercial linkages in the U.K. and Europe .
But the companies said that Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents will market GRE life insurance , pension and investment products through its more than 1,000 retail outlets in the U.K .
Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant , architect William McDonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting .
`` Look how much air is moving around '' he says .
You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air .
Mr. McDonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution , tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues , and avoiding mahogany , which comes from endangered rain forests .
He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space .
What really stirs his muse , though , is aerobic architecture .
Mr. McDonough is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet , the proposed Warsaw Trade Center in Poland , the first such center in Eastern Europe .
Bloomingdale 's plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays .
A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby 's in December .
A 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space .
The windows will open .
To the extent that the $ 150 million budget will allow it , Mr. McDonough will rely on solid wood , rather than plywood or particle board , to limit the emission of formaldehyde .
The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $ 150,000 , with the center 's developer footing the bill .
All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work , says John Burgee , whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square , `` but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme . ''
Mr. McDonough responds : `` I 'm asking people to broaden their agendas . ''
He earned a master 's degree in architecture from Yale .
He and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in Iceland .
At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers .
At Yale , he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland .
The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big , operable windows .
To reduce it at the fund 's building , workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director 's office .
The budget was only $ 400,000 .
The fund 's lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees .
In offices , triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight .
`` We proved a healthy office does n't cost more , '' says Frederic Krupp , executive director of the fund .
But , she says , `` I guess I did n't really notice the trees .
Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the Paul Stuart renovation reflects much of Mr. McDonough 's environmental concern .
It makes extensive use of stainless steel , silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors .
The ambitious Warsaw project still awaits approval by city officials .
He had worked with Mr. McDonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center .
Mr. McDonough thinks of the center as the `` Eiffel Tower of Warsaw '' and `` a symbol of the resurgence of Poland . ''
Jessica Mathews , vice president of World Resources Institute in Washington , D.C. , says that perhaps a quarter of Poland 's soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution .
The future of the forest remains uncertain .
After all , Mr. Muniak says , `` in Poland there are n't too many people worried about the environment .
Pittston Co. 's third-quarter net income plunged 79 % , reflecting the impact of a prolonged and bitter labor strike at its coal operations .
In the year-ago quarter , net totaled $ 14.7 million , or 38 cents a share , including $ 4 million , or 10 cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward .
Pittston also owns Brink 's Inc. , the security service , and Burlington Air Express , the air-freight concern .
As a result , the group 's third-quarter loss widened to $ 9.8 million from the second quarter 's $ 3.6 million .
Burlington 's operating profit grew to $ 9.2 million from $ 3.8 million a year earlier , Pittston said .
Brink 's operating profit was about flat with the year-earlier period , reflecting continued pricing and cost pressures .
Does n't anybody here want to win this mayor 's race ?
Mr. Dinkins , the Manhattan borough president , can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable 20-point lead in most of the public-opinion polls .
Ordinarily , a clever opponent would find a way to capitalize on the other side 's misfortunes .
And now , at the crucial moment , he 's running out of money .
Democrats hoped that Mr. Dinkins could become a highly visible national leader .
But it has n't worked out that way .
The alternative -- Giuliani -- is ghastly . ''
There 's nothing on the other side . ''
He adds : `` It just has n't gotten down to the engine room yet . ''
For , just as Mr. Giuliani latches on to an issue that has Mr. Dinkins reeling , his campaign desperately needs cash to keep Mr. Ailes 's commercials on the air beyond Wednesday or Thursday .
For Republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes , all of this is deeply frustrating .
But the trouble it faces now under Democratic rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything it has faced in the past .
And hardly surprising , many residents trying to cope with the city 's other problems are constantly on edge , one ethnic group scrapping with another .
But , at least , back then they did n't generally direct their anger at each other . ''
He defeated the contentious Mr. Koch in the Democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could heal the city 's racial and ethnic wounds .
His theme is unity , decency , humanity , bringing New York together again .
The 45-year-old Mr. Giuliani has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to Mr. Dinkins .
`` But our polls show voters do n't like the attack stuff .
`` It 's assault-weapons politics , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , insisting there is a strong racist undertone to the Giuliani effort .
On the one hand , Mr. Giuliani wants to cut into Mr. Dinkins 's credibility .
It has n't helped that he 's waffled on abortion and gay rights , sought the support of both the Liberal and Conservative parties -LRB- he won the Liberal endorsement -RRB- and that he turned to comedian Jackie Mason for help with Jewish voters .
Shvartzer is a derogatory Yiddish word for a black person .
He can match Jackie Mason with his own Robert `` Sonny '' Carson , an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974 .
Paper work on how it was spent is incomplete .
Asked about that the other day , he replied , `` Anti-Semitic ?
More troubling for Mr. Dinkins is his record in personal accounting .
`` I was always going to do it tomorrow , '' he explained at the time .
He had valued the shares at more than $ 1 million two years earlier .
He says his son has n't paid for the shares .
`` It follows the same pattern as his tax returns .
`` He simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ 58,000 two years later , '' says Mr. Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager .
So far though , no one -- not even former U.S. attorney Giuliani -- has been able to pinpoint just what law Mr. Dinkins has broken or just what tax he has evaded .
It 's serious stuff .
He 's had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter . ''
The result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think .
Rome magistrates accuse Mr. Carboni and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire -LRB- $ 880,000 -RRB- from the Vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of Roberto Calvi , the Ambrosiano chairman found hanged under London 's Blackfriar 's Bridge shortly before the bank 's collapse .
Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in Panama and Luxembourg that were owned , directly or indirectly , by the Vatican bank .
Italian news reports said Mr. Carboni and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a Vatican official , Pavel Hnilica .
Neither Mr. Hnilica , Mr. Carboni nor Vatican officials could be reached for comment over the weekend .

Royal Business Group Inc. said it filed suit in federal court here charging Realist Inc. and its directors with violating federal securities laws `` by engaging in a scheme to prevent '' Royal from acquiring Realist .
Royal contends that Realist failed to disclose material information , including Realist 's negotiations to acquire Ammann Laser Technik AG , to stockholders prior to Realist 's June 6 annual meeting .
Royal withdrew its offer to buy Realist , a maker of optical and electronic products based in Menomonee Falls , Wis. , for $ 14.06 a share in July after Realist disclosed the Ammann purchase .
A Realist official said the company had n't yet received the full complaint and would n't have a response until it had an opportunity to review it .
The Forest City , Iowa , maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $ 11.3 million , or 46 cents a share , in the quarter ended Aug. 26 .
The cut in the dividend to 10 cents a share semiannually , from 20 cents , `` would indicate to me they do n't see the problems being fixed real quick , '' said Frank Rolfes , an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis .
The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions .
But the rate of the decline snowballed in August , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association .
The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers .
So when there 's talk and concern about the economy , it 's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases . ''
And he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year .
Winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25 % industrywide in August , and 10.4 % in the first eight months of the year .
The news sent Winnebago stock falling 62.5 cents , to $ 5.25 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading-a 52-week low .
Based on his control of about 45 % of Winnebago 's 24.7 million shares , his annual dividend income would be cut to about $ 2.2 million from $ 4.4 million .
Sales rose 2 % to $ 437.5 million from $ 430.3 million .
As the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative .
`` Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity , '' said Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities .
Analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market , which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the Federal Reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks .
Investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall .
Long-term bonds have performed erratically this year .
Total return is price changes plus interest income .
Among other things , economists note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed .
Add it all up and it means `` that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh .
The federal funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the Fed 's credit policy .
Although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred Oct. 13 , it ended Friday at about 8 % .
`` Given our forecast for lower rates , purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end , '' he said .
He says these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets , seek safer securities .

Resolution Funding Corp. , known as Refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction Wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
So far , investors have n't shown much appetite for Refcorp 's initial bond offering .
`` Why should I bother with something that 's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield ? '' he said .
He seems to be typical of many professional money managers .
On Friday , the yield was quoted at about percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand .
But once the new securities are digested , they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data .
If one thinks that rates are going down , you do n't care how much supply is coming . ''
Most bond prices fell on concerns about this week 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline .
In early trading , Treasury bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among Japanese investors would continue .
Those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance .
The benchmark 30-year bond , which traded as high as 102 during the day , ended at 101 .
In the corporate bond market , traders said the new-issue market for junk bonds is likely to pick up following Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. 's $ 475 million junk bond offering Friday .
Traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 % .
However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get done .
If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest . ''
And pressure by big investors forced Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. to sweeten Chicago & North Western 's $ 475 million junk bond offering .
The coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101 .
Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in Chicago & North Western 's parent company .
We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . ''
In the secondary , or resale , market , junk bonds closed point higher , while investment-grade corporate bonds fell to point .
The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection .
Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold .
An Henri Matisse , auctioned last Wednesday , fetched $ 12.4 million , a world record for the artist .
The Better Business Bureau of San Diego and the state Attorney General 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm , Better Book Inc .
Without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories .
The Attorney General 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by Better Book .
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it obtained `` firm '' financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its offer for 50.3 % of LIN Broadcasting Corp .
Further , McCaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $ 4.5 billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks .
McCaw is offering to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $ 125 each in cash , which would result in McCaw owning 50.3 % of the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern .
In national over-the-counter trading Friday , LIN shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $ 110.625 .

A majority of Japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to Mexico under the Brady plan because they 're uncertain the Mexican economy will remain stable .
The plan , proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Nicholas Brady , calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans .
But an official at a long-term credit bank explained that since some larger banks have already taken loss provisions for loans to other Third World nations , further write-offs could be viewed as intolerable .
As a result , the official said , they may be forced into a no-win situation in which they make risky loans that they could have to write off later .

Robert Stein , president and chief executive officer , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company 's Masillon , Ohio , bakeware facility .
But Mr. Stein said he is `` reasonably confident '' that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ 3.1 million , or 17 cents a share , in 1988 .
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , the company had profit of $ 2.7 million , or 15 cents a share .
The year-earlier periods do n't reflect results of the company 's Woodstream Corp. unit , acquired last January , but include some Canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988 .
Mr. Stein said some retailers -- perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories -- appear to have held back on orders in September but have been ordering more heavily in October .
Woodstream 's Victor-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are `` doing very well , '' and its plastic storage-case products `` are poised for growth , '' he said .
Mr. Stein said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989 , reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of Ekco Housewares in late 1987 .
Mr. Stein said tighter operating controls have enabled Ekco to reduce inventory levels 25 % to 30 % ; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95 % from around 70 % ; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit .
In addition to those measures , the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers ' retail outlets -- a strategy that Mr. Stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands .
The main issue in the strike at the Ohio facility was health-care benefits , Mr. Stein said .
Ekco continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry , Mr. Stein said .
After several years of booming business with China , foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade .
Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects .
Givaudan Far East Ltd. , a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in China , typifies the problems .
The company 's sales flattened during 1989 's first half .
In Canton , Givaudan 's representative office received no orders in June .
`` Things have grown worse since June 4 , '' Mr. Lai says .
The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest .
`` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist .
China 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade .
The current trough is expected to be much deeper , because Beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation .
`` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says Raymond Wong , China manager for Mannesmann AG , a West German machinery-trading company .
In the first eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % a year earlier .
Exports in the first eight months grew only 9 % , to $ 31.48 billion , compared with a growth rate of 25 % a year earlier , according to Chinese customs figures .
The reserves dropped for the first time in recent years , to $ 14 billion in June from $ 19 billion in April .
In recent weeks , China 's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities .
Beijing 's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping China export .
Three years ago , the ratio was reversed .
`` Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , '' says Masahiko Kitamura , general manager of Nissho Iwai 's Canton office .
For a short time after June 4 , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright .
Even the Bank of China , which normally took weeks to process letters of credit , was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank 's financial health .
The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of China 's national trading companies , which are among the country 's biggest importers .
Shanghai Investment & Trust Co. , known as Sitco , is the city 's main financier for trading business .
Foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash .
How can it make available funds for purchases ? ''
Albert Lee , a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales , estimates that as many as 70 % of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months .
Even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because Beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown between 30 % and 40 % in the past few years .
Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics .
But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices .
Traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock .
But Beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country 's export business .
Oil Spill Case Shows Liability Fund Flaws
The class-action suit highlights shortcomings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund , which gets its money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills .
Commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that has ballooned to more than $ 104.8 million .
The fund was created by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act , which provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved in an oil spill must pay the first $ 14 million in damages .
The fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief .
Trinidad Corp. is contesting liability .
That means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far .
The spokesman says the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind of Catch-22 . ''
RECENT LAW school graduates are starting jobs with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class .
`` Law school teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , '' says Aaron Weitz , head of a New York County Lawyers ' Association committee that sponsors such a course .
But these days , large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year , and it 's impossible to personally train everyone , says Joel Henning of Hildebrandt Inc. , a consulting firm that runs training classes .
Students also are taught to return clients ' phone calls immediately and to treat the support staff with respect .
At the Baltimore firm of Weinberg & Green , new corporate and banking associates are required to enroll in a 20-class course .
Now , clients know that new associates have had some practical training before working on their cases , says James J. Hanks , a partner at the firm .

IT PAYS to follow a management career path -- even at law firms .
Its survey of 96 firms , each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers , shows that managing partners earned an average of $ 395,974 in compensation and cash benefits in the firms ' 1988 fiscal years .
Partners in the survey who devote most of their time to practicing law earned an average of about $ 217,000 .

First , the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s .
What now ?
Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing .
Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood .
Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera .
But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped .
It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do .
Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora finds an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold .
In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security .
The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty .
The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts -LRB- even the characters ' own -RRB- are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters .
In any case , the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction .
Patrician dynamic Scott Thatcher , , initially finds the takeover threat risible .
Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel .
Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures .
Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this : If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious dolt , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process .
High-definition television promises to be the TV of tomorrow , so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market .
A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s .
Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick .
It already has had success in electroluminescence , another promising technology adaptable for high-definition television .
The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set .
Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment .
General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France .
The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized .
He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that .
The only material support it is extending to the struggling U.S. industry is $ 30 million in awards from the Pentagon 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
The Commerce Department estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion .
Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories .
In the 1970s , Mr. Brody helped develop the first display panels based on active-matrix liquid crystals at Westinghouse Electric Corp. 's research labs in Pittsburgh .
In 1979 , however , Westinghouse abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television .
He has a claim to the right to commercialize the Westinghouse patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers .
They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter . ''
`` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our -LCB- HDTV -RCB- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office .
HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
The Commerce Department also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries .
The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market . ''
Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial .
They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers , including Matsushita , Hitachi , and Toshiba , to exempt portable color TVs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the U.S. imposes on the larger Japanese color TVs .
Planar President James Hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 % to sell his display panels in Japan and South Korea , while panels from those countries enter the U.S. duty-free .
We just have n't learned what it takes to compete .

The office , a Treasury Department unit that is the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year 's thrift-bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public .
Indeed , the OTS said that before the law took effect Aug. 9 , it banned another `` key Vision Banc insider '' from insured financial institutions .
Vision Banc was placed in government conservatorship in March , and it operates under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts .
However , it said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift , including `` extraordinary loan commissions '' paid to a firm associated with Vision Banc officials , and loans diverted through borrowers back to the thrift officials .
Arizona Instrument Corp. said it expects to post a third-quarter net loss of about $ 600,000 , or 25 cents to 27 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 214,000 , or 10 cents a share , a year earlier .
For the nine months , the company expects to post a net loss of about $ 879,000 , or 35 cents to 40 cents a share , on revenue of $ 6.5 million .
Growth is good .
They are starting to buy growth stocks .
The upper echelon of this group were shares of the `` nifty 50 '' companies whose profits of the 1960s and early 1970s grew steadily , if not spectacularly , through thick and thin .
The current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones .
The question for investors is , how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains .
`` I think it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market , '' says Steven Einhorn , partner at Goldman Sachs .
`` The period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits , '' says Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income Fund .
This kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds John Calverley , senior economist for American Express Bank , of the 1969-72 period , when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records , which became known as the `` nifty 50 . ''
Cabanne Smith , president of a money management company bearing his name , predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings `` momentum '' will climb on the growth-stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further .
`` We 're just seeing the beginning of a shift , '' Mr. Smith says .
Ronald Sloan , executive vice president of Siebel Capital Management , likes Wellman Inc. , a company that recycles plastic into synthetic fibers for carpeting .
Wellman stock closed Friday at 39 , up ; Mr. Sloan thinks that in a year it could hit 60 .
Carmine Grigoli , chief market strategist for First Boston , who still says , `` We expect the Dow average -LCB- to be at -RCB- 3000 by mid-1990 , '' nonetheless foresees a sluggish economy in the meantime .
All have a fiveyear earnings growth rate of more than 20 % a year .
`` One of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy , '' says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price .
He recently trimmed his portfolio of International Paper , Dow Chemical , Quantum Chemical , International Business Machines and Digital Equipment .
Big cyclical companies are using `` all the tricks they can to stabilize earnings , '' says Mr. Sloan .

Their $ 700 million-plus in estimated paper losses easily tops the $ 400 million in paper losses the takeover traders , known as arbitragers , suffered in 1982 when Gulf Oil Co. dropped a $ 4.8 billion offer for Cities Service Co .
The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again , as they did in 1982 when Occidental Petroleum Co. rescued them with a $ 4 billion takeover of Cities Service .
The short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ 135 and $ 150 a share .
Airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently about 13 times earnings .
That analysis matches up with stock traders ' reports that , despite the huge drop in the stock , UAL has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings .
One analyst , who asked not to be identified , said he believes that the UAL pilots and management can put together a bid `` in the $ 225 area , '' but that it could take three to four months to close .
Other observers note that UAL 's board , having accepted a bid of $ 300 a share , might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal .
Investment bankers following UAL agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years , and are n't likely to stop , having come so close to success .
On Friday , they also persuaded the UAL flight attendants to join them .
Banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk , that is , subordinate to the bank debt in any deal .
Banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union leader .
One obstacle to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership .
One way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders .
But it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders .
In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions .
First Boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection .
And using liquidation value assuming the sale of all UAL assets , First Boston estimated the airline is worth $ 253 to $ 303 a share .
American Airlines parent AMR and USAir Group , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results .
The deal has , as one takeover expert puts it , `` so many moving parts .
In addition to the need for another cash equity investor , the other moving parts include : the pilots themselves , who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike ; the machinists union , the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal ; and regulators in Washington , whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt .
Wall Street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own UAL stock and options equal to as many as 6.5 million shares , or about 30 % of the total outstanding .
That would indicate that the arbs have paper losses on UAL alone totalling $ 725 million .

Convex makes supercomputers that sell for up to $ 2 million and has an installed base of more than 550 systems and 340 customers world-wide .
Earlier this month , Convex made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems .
Convex also recently agreed to use Posix , a standard for the computer language called UNIX .
Most other supercomputer manufacturers have yet to adopt the Posix standard , Mr. Paluck said , adding that they prefer to maintain proprietary systems that lock in customers .
But the customer does n't want that . ''
Troubled Saatchi & Saatchi Co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units , with potential suitors including Interpublic Group , but has rejected them , people familiar with the company said .
More recently , Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi 's smaller communications companies -- identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed , they said .
A Saatchi spokesman declined to comment about Interpublic .
He added , `` We have no intention of selling either business . ''
The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history .
Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak .
It named a new chief executive officer , former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus .
And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged .
While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .
That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy New York presence .
Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network : It has billings of about $ 850 million and blue-chip clients including General Mills , and Dow Brands .
It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own .
Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units .
Analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses .

Both of Dr. Baltimore 's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious Rockefeller research institution .
They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee , which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore .
Rep. Dingell even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper .
This well may be the first time that the venerable Rockefeller University has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in American science .
Scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this country is n't their concern or that a David Baltimore could have somehow placated a John Dingell .
Something other than what most scientists would recognize as the truth is being sought here . -RRB-
David Hubel , a Nobel laureate at Harvard , has taken the lead in defending research with animals , as has Dr. Michael DeBakey .
Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , today it is also about power .
When a David Baltimore -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces , his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support .

George Bush is quite clear : No new ducks .
We see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the American economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities .
The Clean Air bill -LRB- quack -RRB- .
The Bush White House is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the Nixon White House did : It hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air , better treatment of the disabled , better child care .
The bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly , wondering where all the `` unexpected '' costs came from .
The President came up with a good bill , but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill .
They 'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day , and they 'd regulate the storage facilities .
New entitlements tend to grow , creating a rationale for new taxes .
The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways .
So instead of building more efficient modern plants , utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants .
The bill also imposes the California auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide , as if a car registered in Big Sky , Montana , needed to be as clean as one driven in Los Angeles .
Other analysts say that estimate is low .
It is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation .

The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions .
Running for President in 1980 and 1988 , George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s .
`` Government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of American business , '' the vice president declared when he was head of the task force .
By 1986 , the number of federal regulators was down to about 103,000 .
Holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the Bush presidency .

Confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for September , due for release tomorrow , fail to show a substantial improvement from July and August 's near-record deficits .
But analysts reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his Mansion House speech last Thursday .
`` The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side , '' said Chris Dillow , senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute .
Forecasts for the trade figures range widely , but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the # 2 billion -LRB- $ 3.2 billion -RRB- deficit in the current account reported for August .
Sanjay Joshi , European economist at Baring Brothers & Co. , said there is no sign that Britain 's manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports .
He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only # 1.8 billion in September .
Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August 's unexpected decline , the deficit could narrow to as little as # 1.3 billion .
Nevertheless , he noted , `` No one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position '' in the pound .
In his Mansion House speech , Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect .
But consumer expenditure data released Friday do n't suggest that the U.K. economy is slowing that quickly .
This compares with a 1.6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988 .
Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further .
Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary .
Sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. Lawson 's promise Friday .
Economists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks , the government will be forced to increase rates to 16 % , both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged .

Freight rates , declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation , are bottoming out , turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation .
Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years .
`` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said Clifford Sayre , director of logistics at Du Pont Co .
Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease , compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years .
The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation .
Shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 .
`` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. LaLonde .
Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy . ''
Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor .
Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers .
Less-than-truckload companies , which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer , discounted away a 4.7 % rate increase implemented last April .
Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks .
Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases .
And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said .
And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years .
Ship companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years .
And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates .
Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % , effective next April .

Although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies -- perhaps 40 to 60 -- it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry .
Corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons .
It helps to keep out unions .
What must your management team do to establish corporate due process ?
1 . Make sure you have a strong personnel department .
At Polaroid , the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year ; the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages .
At Citicorp , the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel 's skill in complaint-resolution .
In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle .
See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the `` law '' governing company courts and adjudicators .
In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen .
3 . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator .
An adjudicator system -- that is , an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy .
4 . Make your due-process system visible .
Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints .

The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee .
Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega .
They said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort .
What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House .
However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress .
A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman , Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama .
Not only does this come close to a violation of law , it violates the trust we have all worked to develop . ''
I 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee . ''
Sen. Boren said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules .
Instead , both congressional and administration officials agreed , it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October .
In fact , yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to .
But a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S .
One senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble .
In addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign .
Last week , Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups .
However , last week Mr. Webster 's two top CIA deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in Panama .
The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines , without changing the basic assassination ban , to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders .

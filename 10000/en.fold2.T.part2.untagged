Santa Fe Pacific Corp. is preparing a plan to sell a 20 % stake in its large real estate unit to a California public employee pension fund for $ 400 million , after which it would spin off the realty operation to shareholders .
Santa Fe Pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today , according to people familiar with the transaction .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Santa Fe Pacific closed at $ 20.625 , down 25 cents .
A spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week 's Northern California earthquake .
A spokesman for Chicago-based Santa Fe Pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund .
The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell , the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock , have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments , including possible spinoffs .
The sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations , as well as real estate .
At the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze .
Pension funds rarely own as much as a 20 % stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company .
But fund officials said the Santa Fe Pacific Realty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with California properties .
Under the proposed plan , the fund would also lend Santa Fe Pacific Realty $ 75 million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price .
The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments , Mr. Roulac said .
For the last year , Santa Fe Pacific has redirected its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties , hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio .
In a statement late yesterday , Santa Fe Pacific 's chairman , Robert D. Krebs , said that Santa Fe Pacific Realty would repay more than $ 500 million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff .
It was n't clear where Santa Fe Pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $ 500 million , which would be well above the $ 400 million that California pension fund officials say they plan to provide
The Santa Fe Pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect , saying the deal was still under negotiation .
It also holds nearly 40,000 acres of raw land with development potential , but under a previously announced strategy , the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California , Arizona and the Chicago area .
The California pension fund , which has $ 16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages , could be a valuable funding source for that development , although it is n't obliged to make further investments .
Fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with Santa Fe Pacific , but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago .
GAF , Part III is scheduled to begin today .
The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government 's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations .
The government 's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness , Boyd L. Jefferies , the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky , and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin , takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian .
Mr. Jefferies 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing .
The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly , but unintentionally , withheld a document .
Meanwhile , a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June .
In August , Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts .
The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF , Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo .
GAF faces potential fines of $ 500,000 for each count .
There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF 's attorney , Arthur Liman , and Mr. Sherwin 's counsel , Stephen Kaufman , will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman .
For now , defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans .
DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal .
The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other .
The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims .
The latter provision is `` legally unprecedented , '' said Alan B. Morrison , a public interest lawyer in Washington , D.C. , who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants .
The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries .
American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins , but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted .
The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6 .
Charles A. Donohoo , sole proprieter of a Louisville , Ky. , demolition company , was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act .
Under Superfund , those who owned , generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup , regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time .
But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment .
Mr. Donohoo was convicted in Louisville late last month of violating Superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was demolishing .
The government sought a criminal penalty because `` no cleanup is possible here .
Mr. Donohoo is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 11 .
Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act .
Wilmer , Cutler & Pickering , the Washington , D.C. , law firm that spent over $ 1 million fighting the execution of mass-murderer Ted Bundy -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the Supreme Court , this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in Arkansas .
The key issue in the case , which the law firm is handling without a fee , or pro bono , is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review .
Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons 's death sentence in a `` next friend '' capacity .
P.J. Mode , Wilmer Cutler 's managing partner , says the trial team that represented Mr. Bundy was asked by the firm 's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised .
`` We give them a lot of credit for taking this case , '' says WLF 's Alan Slobodin .
James Burke and Larry Evans , formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery , and Prudence Clark , a Barclay sales representative , were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed , limited-edition lithographs .
Henry Pitman , the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case , said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that Barclay 's total proceeds from the sales were $ 3.4 million .
The posters were printed on paper pre-signed by Mr. Dali , the attorneys said .
The banking company could n't be reached to comment beyond a written announcement .
Westamerica said Mr. Decker 's posts were assumed by David Payne , Westamerica 's chairman , who at 34 years of age becomes one of the youngest chief executives of a sizable bank in the country .
Neither Mr. Payne nor Mr. Decker could be reached to comment .
It controls about 35 % of the affluent Marin County market across the Golden Gate bridge from San Francisco .
He was brought to the company in September 1988 after 15 years at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp .
When he was hired , Mr. Payne lauded Mr. Decker 's `` extraordinary... skills '' and his `` outstanding reputation as one of the West 's brightest bankers . ''

It said it will exercise that right only if it sells substantially all of its other core businesses .
Also , the broker-dealer subsidiary , Integrated Resources Equity Corp. , was renamed Royal Alliance Associates Inc .
Royal Alliance , to which the 3,900 representatives ' licenses will be transferred , is a shell company Integrated owns .
Integrated will pump $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million into Royal Alliance as initial funding .
If Integrated regains Royal Alliance , the representatives will retain their 49 % ownership .
The subsidiary is n't expected to be profitable for at least one year .
If the deal closes , the two officers will draw salaries from the independent operation , not from Integrated .
`` I think it was something that we and they thought was constructive , '' said Stephen D. Weinroth , chairman and co-chief executive officer of Integrated .
In New York Stock Exchange Composite trading , Integrated shares closed at $ 1.125 , up 12.5 cents .

Exxon Corp. filed suit against the state of Alaska , charging state officials interfered with the oil company 's initial efforts to treat last spring 's giant oil spill .
The state 's suit alleges that Exxon 's response to the spill failed to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound .
Neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely because damage assessment has n't yet been completed .
Litigation , if not settled out of court , could drag on for years .
The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef .
Exxon has made them before , at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue .
Since the spill last March , Exxon and the state have been wrangling over whether spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill , when the weather was clear and calm , would have helped limit the environmental damage .
The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard .
Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say Exxon 's charges are n't relevant because tests conducted during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway .

The House Appropriations Committee approved an estimated $ 2.85 billion in emergency funding to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and to extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo .
By a 26-7 margin , the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative , and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten -LRB- D. , Miss . -RRB- and his party 's largest state delegation in the House .

A master of pork-barrel politics , he had crafted the $ 2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative .
On the chairman 's motion , the California package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language , and even when this was accepted as such on a voice vote , Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it .
Mr. Whitten 's package appears to accomplish this purpose , but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in the next six months .

The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants .
Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought under the racketeering law , the official , David Runkel , said .
The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law .
The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers .
The department 's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of the alleged offense , Mr. Runkel said .
In general , the thrust of the department 's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction , Mr. Runkel said .
Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez .
But instead of thanks , Sen. Cranston was treated with cool formality .
Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate , where California Sen. Cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor , Charles Keating Jr. , principal stockholder of Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. of Phoenix , Ariz .
Mr. Keating arranged nearly $ 1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes , and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers .
Unlike many lawmakers , Chairman Gonzalez says he considers intervening with regulators to be improper .
And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously .
Lawmakers often are reluctant to embarrass colleagues , even those of opposing political parties .
But Chairman Gonzalez is a genuine maverick .
Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open .
The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez 's inquiry is Danny Wall , chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision .
Rep. Gonzalez seems primed to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco , William Black and Mike Patriarca .
Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to Washington by Mr. Wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance .
Mr. Wall , however , is a self-proclaimed `` child of the Senate '' and former staff director of its Banking Committee .
They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years .
This is raising eyebrows .
There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators . ''
All the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent .
Chairman Gonzalez expresses sympathy for Sen. Riegle , his counterpart as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
But at the same time , Mr. Gonzalez has n't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. Wall during House-Senate negotiations over S* bailout legislation during the summer .
They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve Mr. Wall 's job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about Lincoln S&L .
At the time , Mr. Gonzalez said several senators told him that they `` could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn 's insistence on Wall . ''
`` In a way , that 's what this is , '' Mr. Gonzalez concedes .
Mr. Keating raised $ 20,000 for Rep. Doug Barnard 's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering .
But the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ 1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others .
A witness set to testify on Thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying Lincoln `` laundered '' campaign contributions illegally .
`` I do n't know whether it was done properly or not , because I 'm not a lawyer , '' he said in a telephone interview yesterday .
The committee also has summoned Mr. Wall 's predecessor , Edwin Gray .
So the senators must brace themselves .
When Anne Volokh and her family immigrated to the U.S. 14 years ago , they started life in Los Angeles with only $ 400 .
Not surprisingly , she quickly adapted to the American way .
-LRB- `` A `` A turban , '' she specifies , `` though it was n't the time for that 14 years ago .
Since then she has become wealthy .
Most recently , she has become the publisher of Movieline , a four-year-old Los Angeles magazine that began national distribution last month , with an initial press run of 100,000 copies .
It 's being sold through bookstores , newsstands and some video stores .
Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev , when she lived with her parents , her husband and her two sons in a 2 apartment in what she calls `` silent internal immigration , '' dreaming of escape .
However , she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase -- that years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel .
She keeps track of the rest of her hats by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox .
`` No , darling , '' she said recently in her fluent , slightly affected English , during a trip East to promote Movieline 's national expansion .
I used to wear hats in Russia , but I had to make them and my dresses .
Now 48 years old , Ms. Volokh has definite ideas about what she wants .
In restaurants -LRB- in this case , the Russian Samovar , a New York restaurant operated by and for Soviet emigres -RRB- , she did n't want the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room .
That done , Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes she feels she was born with : an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties .
If you are born to give parties , you give parties .
In Los Angeles , in our lean years , we gave parties . ''
She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people , but prefers more intimate gatherings .
I like rather tea , because it is at the end of the day . ''
It 's supposed to be later but I just moved it .
She also frequently invites directors , producers , actors , writers and other show business people for `` coffee and clips in the pleasure dome . ''
They eat `` sinful and sensual things '' -- and explain their clips .
The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs , Boris Krutchensky -LRB- who has the title of co-publisher -RRB- , and Laurie Halpern Smith , now the magazine 's co-editor .
She was interested only if she could guide it editorially as well .
She wants things to be exciting .
She 'll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible , then she 'll have us make it work . ''
Back in the Soviet Union she was a respected journalist , writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday Izvestia .
`` I do n't trust people who do n't eat , '' said Ms. Volokh , though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop 25 pounds .
No one ever eats in their books and look at them .
In her cookbook , which Macmillan is bringing out in soft cover this month -LRB- with the blini recipe revised so it works -RRB- , she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature : Pushkin on blini , Goncharov on piroghi .
In a great restaurant , do n't deprive yourself .
Amusing as she is , and frivolous as she can seem , this is a serious person with some difficult memories .
Her mother was a translator ; her father was `` the eternal vice director . ''
But we should n't leave out political reasons , number one .
One can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives . ''
The wait was miserable .
Mr. Volokh was fired from his job , and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities .
They did n't .
Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field , but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available a Russian who spoke fluent English .
I wanted to be in business . ''
Soon she was running the office .
Now Movieline is located in the same building as Vesoft .
You never know if you 'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one .
William D. Forrester , president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council , has a warning for U.S. companies trying to do business in the Soviet Union .
We are not trying to encourage everyone . ''
Doing business with the Russians , once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans , has become the goal of such major companies as General Motors Corp. , Federal Express Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. , as well as a cluster of smaller firms .
But while U.S. interest may be big and growing , the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating .
Executives say Mr. Gorbachev 's moves to break up the government 's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities .
And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles , their ventures now have to be endorsed by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics .
As part of that attempt , by the American Trade Consortium , Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying .
Over the past two years , Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms , including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S. , Montedison S.p . A. of Italy and several Japanese groups , about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants .
Whatever the difficulties , Mr. Gorbachev remains committed to increasing foreign trade .
Talking to a small group of U.S. executives afterwards , Mr. Gorbachev appeared impatient for a big expansion in U.S.-Soviet trade , which now amounts to a meager $ 3 billion annually .
According to several people present at the meeting , Mr. Gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the U.S. , possibly at his next summit meeting with President Bush .
Hundreds of people lined up every day at the Colgate-Palmolive Co. stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste , a commodity in chronically short supply here .
Some U.S. products are filtering into the Soviet market under an emergency import program .
The American Trade Consortium says it is planning to ship some $ 500 million of consumer goods , financed by bank credits , in the first few months of next year .
The goal of most U.S. firms -- joint ventures -- remains elusive .
International competition for the few Soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up , however .
Seeking to overcome the currency problems , Mr. Giffen 's American Trade Consortium , which comprises Chevron Corp. , RJR , Johnson & Johnson , Eastman Kodak Co. , and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings , largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project .
`` It 's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries , '' says Dennis A. Sokol , president of Medical Service Partners Inc. , who is putting the medical consortium together .
One group seeks to publish a U.S.-Soviet medical journal in conjunction with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health .
It will be financed by advertisements from U.S. companies and by simultaneous publication of an English-language journal containing details of Soviet medical advancements .
It 's truly entrepreneurial .
Westinghouse Electric Corp. also won a $ 75.5 million Navy contract for nuclear propulsion parts .
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. was awarded an $ 11.5 million Navy contract for oceanographic services .
The system is the first to be sold through the joint marketing agreement between Cray and Control Data Corp .
Shareholders of Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano S.p . A. voted to accept a bid of 5,500 lire -LRB- $ 4.03 -RRB- a share by France 's Credit Agricole for 13.32 % of the bank , rejecting an earlier , equal offer by Italy 's Assicurazioni Generali S.p . A .
It also opens a rift in the bank 's shareholders ' syndicate that could lead to a battle for control of the concern .
Credit Agricole asked a Milan court to sequester the Nuovo Banco shares , the Italian news agency ANSA reported .
No reason for the request was given .
The decision to accept Credit Agricole 's bid , valued at 283.3 billion lire -LRB- $ 207.4 million -RRB- , came after a stormy weekend meeting .
Gemina , which owns 13.26 % of Nuovo Banco , abstained in the final vote on Credit Agricole , which was nonetheless approved by a majority of shareholders .
Since then , the bank has strengthened its Italian network , and has posted strong results .
Gemina said in a statement that `` it reserves the right to take any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate . ''
Generali , Italy 's biggest insurer , last month offered 5,500 lire a share for the Nuovo Banco stake held by Banco Popolare di Milano , the bank 's largest shareholder , which announced plans to sell the holdings earlier this year .
On the Milan stock exchange , Nuovo Banco 's shares jumped to 4,830 lire each from 4,695 lire Friday .
Mr. Skase , a 41-year-old former newspaper reporter who chairs the company , said in a statement that Qintex will sell its 51 % stake in its upscale Mirage resorts in Australia and Hawaii as well as three Australian television stations .
Qintex Australia has n't disclosed its borrowings , but analysts estimate the company 's debt at A$ 1.2 billion .
He said the move will `` significantly reduce administrative and operating costs , '' but he did n't provide details of the merger .
Friday , Qintex Entertainment Inc. , a 43%-owned U.S. affiliate , filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code .
The company 's latest moves were disclosed after the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares of Qintex Australia and Qintex Ltd. because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans , investments and deposits at Qintex Entertainment .
It said Qintex Entertainment owes Qintex Australia US$ 38.1 million in loans not secured by specific assets .
In the statement , Mr. Skase said that on the basis of current interest rates in Australia , the company 's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about A$ 120 million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities .
Yesterday 's statement did n't say whether the Japanese companies will acquire Qintex 's remaining stake in the resorts .
The shares traded at about A$ 1.50 in March , when the plan to acquire was announced .
Mr. Skase 's statement cited four recent problems that he said had cut group cash flow by more than A$ 200 million .
has sued Qintex Australia for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement , and Qintex Australia has threatened a countersuit .
In his statement , Mr. Skase said preliminary accounts showed that group profit before interest , tax and depreciation `` will exceed A$ 170 million . ''
Shareholders ' funds as of July 31 were estimated at more than A$ 1 billion , Mr. Skase said , compared with A$ 725 million a year earlier .
Mr. Skase also disclosed a disagreement among directors of Qintex Australia over certain fees claimed by Qintex Group Management Services Pty. , a management-services concern in which Qintex Australia executives have an interest .
Mr. Skase said most of the money went to other parties for expenses such as rent and travel , but a smaller portion is owed to senior executives and others for management services .
Two of the directors resigned , Mr. Skase said , so the payments have n't yet been approved .
TWO COMPANIES plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off .
National Semiconductor Corp. and a start-up named Ramtron Corp. plan to start shipping so-called ferroelectric memories , which can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to them .
Developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology is n't fully refined .
The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment , including floppy-disk and hard-disk drives .
National says it agreed to acquire Krysalis 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips , including a 4-kilobit memory , next year .
In addition to not needing an outside power source , they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips .
And while today 's non-volatile chips -- such as electronically erasable programmable read-only memory chips -- ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they `` learn '' data slowly , ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds .
AN AUSTIN , Texas , company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town .
That means huge travel bills .
That could change , thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics .
The company installed a prototype system that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines .
While lawyers arranged individual tie-ups before , the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper .
Japanese Reverse Tack On Patent Protection
Now at least one Japanese company is turning the courtroom tables .
But last year Hitachi Ltd. surprised Japan 's electronics industry when it accused Korea 's Samsung Electronics Co. of using Hitachi technology to make dynamic random-access memory chips .
And Hitachi went on the offensive against the U.S. 's Motorola Inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that Motorola 's new MC88200 chip infringes on a Hitachi patent .
The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say Japan is starting to take .
Hitachi charges Motorola `` has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain Motorola patents '' used in Motorola 's MC68030 microprocessor chip .
Motorola either denied or would n't comment on the various charges .
COMPUTER chips that simulate human vision have been developed by Japan 's Sharp Corp .
Sharp says the set of chips could improve fax machines , graphics computers or identification systems that recognize facial features .
Using reduced instruction-set computing , or RISC , chips made by Intergraph of Huntsville , Ala. , the system splits the image it `` sees '' into 20 digital representations , each processed by one chip .
The results , which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of flat-to-lower earnings for the big electronics retailer , disappointed analysts and traders .
Net for the quarter was $ 62.8 million , or 73 cents a share , down from $ 64.9 million , or 72 cents a share , a year earlier .
Tandy had 86.3 million shares outstanding at Sept. 30 , down from 90 million a year earlier .
Tandy said consumer electronics sales at its Radio Shack stores have been slow , partly because of a lack of hot , new products .
He said Tandy `` has done a decent job '' increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its Grid Systems Corp. subsidiary , which sells computers to bigger businesses , but `` it 's not enough to offset the problems at Radio Shack . ''
As a result , Mr. Telzrow said he cut his fiscal 1990 per-share earnings estimate for Tandy to $ 4.05 from $ 4.20 .
Barry Bryant , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , said Tandy also has suffered from lethargic sales of its computers aimed at the home and small-office market , which are less-advanced and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market .
Mr. Bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help Tandy 's results improve in the important Christmas quarter .
If the earnings acceleration is to take place , that should be the quarter .
Mr. Joseph conceded the junk market was in disarray , according to people familiar with the discussion .
The dinner was a stark confirmation that 1989 is the worst year ever for the $ 200 billion junk market .
Amid the market disorder , even Drexel , which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors , is pulling in its horns .
For many money managers , the past four months have been humiliating .
In the third quarter , for example , junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns , the only major sector of the bond market to do so .
The junk market , which mushroomed to $ 200 billion from less than $ 2 billion at the start of the decade , has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments .
Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale .
In an interview , Mr. Joseph says his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk .
Nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years , and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable parameters of the market . ''
Unlike the New York Stock Exchange , where buyers and sellers are quickly matched , the junk market , where risky corporate loans are traded , is sometimes closed for repairs .
In recent months , they say , there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors , while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them .
Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced `` above-normal '' redemptions by shareholders , Deltec said .
And , Deltec said , buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation .
Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say they are managing their junk portfolios defensively , building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality .
`` We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here , and it 's something to be concerned about , '' says James A. Gregoire , a managing director .
This market teaches us to be humble . ''
Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default , the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble , says Stuart Reese , manager of Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co. 's $ 17 billion investment-grade public bond portfolio .
And the risks are n't appropriate for us , '' he says .
The string of big junk bond defaults , which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year , probably will persist , some analysts say .
Mr. Asquith , whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed last April , says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings .
One indication of a growing number of junk defaults , Mr. Asquith says , is that about half of the $ 3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by S&P this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of 1984 through 1986 .
`` Obviously , we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky , '' says Bradford Cornell , professor of finance at University of California 's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles .
Mr. Cornell says : `` The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel claimed , but it also is n't a disaster as the doomsayers say . ''
During the past three weeks , for example , Drexel has sold $ 1.3 billion of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co. , Uniroyal Chemical , Continental Air and Duff & Phelps .
Troubled Drexel-underwritten issues include Resorts International , Braniff , Integrated Resources , SCI TV , Gillette Holdings , Western Electric and Southmark .
`` But the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste .
Then , flashing a diamond ring as big as the Ritz -LRB- `` my day diamond , darling '' -RRB- , she told her two companions that she is on the `` board '' of the Vatican Museum in Rome .
But Mrs. Boehm did n't mention any of them .
Like which are droppable and which are not .
But the truth is that almost everyone , from real-estate agents to city fathers , name-drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the Katzenjammer Kids .
`` Name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , '' says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high-powered clientele .
It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know . ''
I was having a drink in Sardi 's , when all of a sudden I saw a woman 's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks .
So I said , ` Hello . '
Can you imagine ?
Some people must drop names -- call it an irresistible impulse .
Beauregard Houston-Montgomery , a New York writer who changed his name from William Stretch in 1980 , is an inveterate name-dropper .
Name-dropping recently helped Mr. Houston-Montgomery crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol .
After all , Warhol was the ultimate namedropper , dropping five a day in his diaries .
Mr. Houston-Montgomery says that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes , publisher of Forbes magazine -LRB- `` We've been in the columns together '' -RRB- , Mary Boone , a New York art dealer -LRB- `` I `` I think she knows me , but I 'm not sure `` -RRB- and Bridget Fonda , the actress -LRB- `` She knows me , but we 're not really the best of friends '' -RRB- .
These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps , Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher .
It 's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts . ''
In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer .
It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock'n ' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant .
`` It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , '' says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths .
`` Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , '' Mr. Miller says .
`` Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in Van Nuys and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original Lone Ranger lived there , '' says David Rambo , a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co. , a Los Angeles real-estate agency .
It is John Hart . -RRB-
`` If Flynn had n't lived there , the property might have been priced $ 1 million lower , '' says Mr. Rambo , noting that Flynn 's house has been bulldozed , and only the swimming pool remains .
And some even do it with malice aforethought .
He says that when Dan Dorfman , a financial columnist with USA Today , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman 's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump , Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis .
`` But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , '' Mr. Kessler says .
Jeffry Thal , a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud .
Mr. Thal says that Elizabeth Taylor , a client , `` hates being called ` Liz . '
She prefers ` Elizabeth . ' ''
And her husband sometimes calls her `` Ducky . ''
John Spencer Churchill , a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill , former prime minister of Great Britain , is n't that impressed with most name-droppers he meets .
Currently writing his memoirs , Mr. Churchill , an artist , tells how tycoons such as the late Jean Paul Getty , the oil billionnaire , were , in fact , known only by one initial , their last .
Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean .
Now that 's name-dropping , if you know what I mean .
SMYRNA , Ga. -- The auto-dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along Cobb Parkway , stretching from the Perimeter highway that circles Atlanta to the `` Big Chicken , '' a pullet-roofed fast-food restaurant and local landmark .
Now there are 23 .
Under construction is the strip 's 24th showroom , the future home of Lexus , a luxury marque launched by Toyota Motor Corp. just two months ago .
And especially , as the Cobb Parkway strip attests , in cars .
For car marketers , it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block .
Malcolm MacDougall , vice chairman of the Jordan , McGrath , Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York , calls the proliferation `` nameplate mania . ''
`` The winners , '' he predicts , `` will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value . ''
He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models , rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines .
`` There 's more noise out there , and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it , '' says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp .
Jeanene Page , of North Salt Lake City , Utah , likes the broader selection .
Now , the 55-year-old car shopper is zeroing in on a full-sized van , figuring that it 's just the thing to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time .
Market segmentation in cars is n't new , but it 's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago .
Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose .
Today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans .
For every brand like Renault or Fiat that has been squeezed out , others such as Isuzu , Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in .
GM launched the Geo marque this year to sell cars made in partnership with foreign auto makers , and next year GM 's long-awaited Saturn cars will make their debut .
But slow sales forced Ford to kill the brand just last week .
The Wall Street Journal 's `` American Way of Buying '' survey found that 53 % of today 's car buyers tend to switch brands .
Which cars do Americans favor most these days ?
Adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury cars , convertibles and imports far more than their elders do .
Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37 % to 28 % margin -- even though older buyers , because of their incomes , are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car .
That 's true of only 14 % of households headed by someone 60 or older .
`` For many baby boomers , buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience , '' says Christopher Cedergren , auto-market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills , Calif .
Only 58 % of Americans now believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models , the Journal survey found , down from 68 % in 1987 .
On the other hand , only 42 % say foreign cars are less comfortable than U.S. models , down from 55 % in 1987 .
`` Once buying habits are formed , they 're very hard to break , '' declares Thomas Mignanelli , executive vice president for Nissan 's U.S. sales operations .
`` The competition is so intense that an owner 's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent , '' says Mr. Negas , vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile , one of the first dealerships to locate on the strip .
The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the Cobb Parkway strip .
Just down the street , Chris Volvo invites serious shoppers to test-drive a new Volvo to any other dealership along the strip , and compare the cars side-by-side .
GM 's Cadillac division , ignoring Detroit 's long-held maxim that safety does n't sell , is airing television commercials touting its cars ' safety features .
Some 60 % of the survey respondents said they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag .
Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 .
But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days .
The reason : Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today 's .
`` Even if it 's only 1 % , '' says GM 's Mr. Barabba , `` would you throw away sales the size of Polaroid ? ''
The workers install , maintain and repair its private branch exchanges , which are large intracompany telephone networks .
Edward Carlson awoke one morning last month to find eight holes in his front yard where his prized miniature palms , called cycads , once stood .
`` The second time , '' he says , `` they left the shovel . ''
Cycads , the most popular of which is the Sago Palm , are doll-sized versions of California 's famous long-necked palms , with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds .
`` Evidently , somebody has realized it 's easy money to steal these things , '' says Loran Whitelock , a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum .
`` It 's hard to think someone is raping your garden , '' he says .
The Sago has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts , apparently giving the rustlers a ready market for their filched fronds .
The department is advising residents to plant Sagos , if they must , in the back yard and telling nurseries to be on the lookout for anyone trying to palm one off .
After three Sagos were stolen from his home in Garden Grove , `` I put a big iron stake in the ground and tied the tree to the stake with a chain , '' he says proudly .
Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume .
A daily average of 20.9 million shares traded in program strategies in September , the second-highest level ever .
Average daily trading volume in June of 180.3 million shares was considerably higher than in September .
The Big Board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks .
It 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market .
Overall , Salomon reported program trading volume of 75.2 million shares .
Of Morgan Stanley 's 66.8 million shares in program trades for the month , 53.1 million were in stock-index arbitrage trades .
A group of shareholders filed suit against Imperial Corp. of America , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , First Executive Corp. and others , charging them with artificially inflating Imperial 's stock price to protect certain major investors .
It also charges that Imperial , the holding company for Imperial Savings & Loan , experienced major losses and writedowns because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages .
Imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities .
Imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in Barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems .
Spokesmen at Drexel and First Executive said the companies had n't yet been served with the suit .
Imperial said it had n't been served with this suit either .
The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share .
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days .
Rhone-Poulenc S.A. , Paris , said it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of RTZ Corp. , a British mining and industrial group .
It did n't release terms of the transaction .
A group including Gene E. Phillips , former chairman of Southmark Corp. , and William S. Friedman , former vice chairman of Southmark , lowered its stake in the Dallas real estate concern to 7.7 % , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The filing said the group continues to hold 3,481,887 remaining shares .
The move also helps the Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business -- for which it holds a virtual monopoly , supplying every Hollywood movie company -- is n't made obsolete by the upstart HDTV business .
`` The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along , '' says David Niles , president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc. , a New York pioneer in high-definition programming .
Japanese electronic giants , such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. , have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware , and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition .
It 's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing .
Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers .
It would be like `` watching a black and white movie on a color TV set , '' says Malcolm G. Saull , chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
Kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market , but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years .
And the potential market is tremendous , industry experts say .
Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations .
And Mr. Niles , the program producer , contends that Kodak 's move is `` a sound marketing decision .
Indeed , the stakes are high .
HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines , compared with 525 for today 's televisions , providing considerably sharper detail .
But the financial rewards are n't expected soon , nor are they guaranteed .
Some critics say they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price .
`` Kodak understands HDTV is where everybody is going , '' says RIT 's Mr. Spaull .
But this time it 's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members .
Already , ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month .
`` The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast , '' says Shigezo Hayasaka , former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst .
This time , the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry .
The donations so far appear to be small , especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co . influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year .
Pachinko is slightly on the shady side , often linked to the lower ranks of Japan 's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders .
Also , about 60 % of pachinko parlor owners are Korean , many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations , and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan .
Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country .
At 500 yen -LRB- $ 3.60 -RRB- for a handful of balls , pachinko is a common pastime , and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II .
And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion , some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen .
In 1984 , an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions .
The proposal split the industry in two , along the lines of national origin : North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans , Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral .
The magazine alleged that in making the donations , the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards , or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents ' organization , the Chosen Soren .
And at first , neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue .
Within a matter of weeks , less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations .
Then the two camps upped the ante : Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members .
On Friday , the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry , including 450,000 yen -LRB- $ 3,175 -RRB- by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu .
Direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign , but both groups deny making direct donations .
The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents , those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese .
Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians , the way many Japanese do , to win favor or support .
But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP 's alleged donations , implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally .
Unfortunately , his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night , and she was adamant about his attending .
But once Perlman started playing , I did n't give a damn about basketball .
Today , it 's obvious that the brawny , six-foot , one-inch musician made the right choice .
He 's currently in the midst of a 17-city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia , with stops including Charleston , S.C . -LRB- Oct. 25 -RRB- , Sarasota , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 28 -RRB- , Tampa , Fla . -LRB- Oct. 29 -RRB- and Miami -LRB- Oct. 31 -RRB- .
Yet Mr. McDuffie 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries .
His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz , a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student ; Cho-Liang Lin , who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18 ; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg , who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition .
But I was n't ready for a career at that time . ''
`` He taught me how to play like a gypsy , '' jokes the musician .
After studies at that conservatory 's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian , he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay , Mr. Galamian 's longtime assistant and , ultimately , his rival .
But she was always encouraging .
In my freshman year , my roommate was known as a party animal .
As the violinist tells it , his grandmotherly looking teacher `` put her hands on her hips , stomped her foot and said , ` You 've just got to get the -LCB- expletive deleted -RCB- out of there . ' ''
Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital .
That 's the only note that 's truly in tune . . . ' . ''
Now , when I play with orchestras , the musicians often compliment me on my intonation . ''
After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's `` Violin Concerto , '' Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer , who was dying of cancer .
He did n't say much , but what he said was important because it 's not in the score .
The only time the violin has it is right at the end .
And he yelled out ` dolce dolce ' -LCB- ` sweet sweet ' -RCB- . ''
I played very transparently , with the tip of the bow .
I do n't know why Barber never told anybody else .
Since leaving Juilliard , Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones .
By contrast , he 's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman 's `` Violin Concerto , '' which he recently recorded for along with Leonard Bernstein 's engaging `` Serenade for Violin Solo , Strings and Percussion . ''
Aided by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin 's direction , this `` Serenade '' really swings .
But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist , brass and timpani .
His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed .
Whatever he plays , Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself -- `` something greater out there than me , '' as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment he shares with wife , Camille , a literary publicist .
Even when I hear it played badly , I 'm still humbled by the piece .
Ms. Jepson is a free-lance music writer in New York .
A lot of observers think so , and , if they 're right , the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt .
And another wave of bad loans would further batter many already-shaky lending institutions .
During the almost seven-year-old economic expansion , inflation-adjusted gross national product , disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30 % , but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66 % .
However , these figures do n't seem to worry Thomas A. Durkin , an economist at the Federal Reserve Board .
He adds : `` We are now witnessing a slowdown which , if history is a guide , could persist for a while . ''
Mr. Durkin doubts that `` there is some magic level '' at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income `` indicates economic problems . ''
The chart below shows why -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23 , 1989 -RRB- .
Moreover , the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be `` lower in this cycle than earlier , '' Mr. Durkin says .
In addition , he says , `` longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden . ''
Citing figures on home-equity loans , he notes that `` 11 % of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts , but the proportion rises to 16 % of homeowners in the $ 45,000-$60,000 income range and 23 % of homeowners with income above $ 60,000 . ''
`` The most frequent use is home improvement , which presumably improves the value of the property , '' Mr. Durkin says .
A severe recession could , of course , raise delinquency rates , but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to loom as a major threat .
In July , consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987 .
As a result , household debt appears to be stabilizing at around 63 % of GNP . ''
Maidenform Inc. loves to be intimate with its customers , but not with the rest of the public .
`` There are very few companies that can boast of such a close-knit group , '' says Robert A. Brawer , 52 years old , recently named president , succeeding Beatrice Coleman , his mother-in-law , who remains chairman .
Mrs. Coleman , 73 , who declined to be interviewed , is the Maidenform strategist .
Maidenform says it is very profitable but declines to provide specifics .
Its current ad campaign , on which Maidenform has spent more than $ 15 million since fall 1987 , does n't even show its underwear products , but rather men like Christopher Reeve , star of the `` Superman '' movies , talking about their lingerie turn-ons .
Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as `` I dreamed I... in my Maidenform bra , '' and `` The Maidenform woman . You never know where she 'll turn up . ''
`` The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly -LCB- Maidenform -RCB- is a force to be reckoned with , '' says David S. Leibowitz , a special situations analyst at American Securities Corp. in New York .
Although Mr. Brawer 's appointment as president was long expected , the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising .
Warnaco also owns Warners , another major intimate apparel maker .
But Maidenform officials say that after spending 24 years at Maidenform , Mr. Lesk , 48 , made it clear he wanted the top job .
The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people .
Top officers insist Maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership .
`` It is fun competing as a private company , '' Mr. Brawer says .
Other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way .
And last year , Playtex Holdings Inc. went private for about $ 680 million .
Publicly traded VF Corp. , which owns Vanity Fair , and Sara Lee Corp. , which owns Bali Co. , are also strong forces in intimate apparel .
When he gets calls , `` I do n't even have to consult '' with Mrs. Coleman , Mr. Masket says .
`` Over the past three and a half years , apparel companies , many of whom have strong brand names , have been bought at about 60 % of sales , '' says Deborah Bronston , Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. apparel analyst .
Mr. Brawer 's wife , Catherine , and Robert Stroup , Elizabeth 's husband , round out the five-member board .
`` We are all very amiable , '' Mr. Brawer says .
In the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that boosted sales .
While Mr. Rosenthal introduced new undergarment designs , his wife , Ida , concentrated on sales and other financial matters .
The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the U.S. , Puerto Rico , other parts of the Caribbean and Ireland .
Before joining Maidenform in 1972 , Mr. Brawer , who holds a doctoral degree in English from the University of Chicago , taught at the University of Wisconsin .
To maintain exclusivity of that designer line , it is n't labeled with the Maidenform name .
Mrs. Coleman 's husband , Joseph , a physician , succeeded Mrs. Rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in 1968 .
According to the report , completed last month , if China 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year , the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991 .
The $ 14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much .
According to Chinese customs figures , import growth has slowed in recent months , dropping to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August from the year-earlier periods , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half .
The $ 14 billion level in June marked a drop from $ 19 billion at the end of April .
China might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did to arrest the 1985 decline , when Beijing slammed the brakes on foreign-exchange spending and devalued the currency .
For example , China 's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4 .
Because of this and the huge trade gap , the deficit in China 's current account , which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds , is expected to widen sharply from the $ 3.8 billion deficit last year .
In one , imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25 % and 5 % recorded during the first seven months , and the current-account deficit widens to $ 13.1 billion .
The other scenario assumes that Beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months .
If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders , it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the current-account deficit .
Even if borrowing resumes , commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before .
On top of all this , foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992 .
The Western government report 's first scenario assumes a 30 % reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5 % contraction in foreign direct investment .
But in either case , the report says , China 's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves , which are used to finance the imbalance .
Roche Holding AG , parent of the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group , said its group sales rose 22 % in the first nine months of the year to 7.32 billion francs -LRB- $ 4.51 billion -RRB- .
Roche also said it expects a `` considerable rise '' in 1989 group profit from the 641.5 million-franc -LRB- $ 396 million -RRB- net in 1988 .

New Canaan Investments is a closely held investment partnership with interests primarily in the packaging industry .
At 18,000 feet , he says , he and his co-pilot `` were looking for an interstate or a cornfield '' to land .
But knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs , Mr. Brown skipped his stop in nearby Chicago and set course to get his load -- a few hundred parcels -- to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time .
But he flies for Federal Express Corp. , perhaps the closest thing in corporate America to the Green Berets .
Like Mr. Brown , they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal : delivering the goods on time .
That may soon change .
The election , which would bring the first major union to Federal 's U.S. operations , has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as Mr. Brown .
`` A union , sooner or later , has to have an adversary , and it has to have a victory , '' Frederick W. Smith , Federal 's chairman and chief executive , says with disdain .
What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots .
Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers .
`` Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company , '' says Bernard La Londe , a professor at Ohio State University at Columbus and a Federal consultant .
Since founding the company , the charismatic Vietnam vet , who is still only 46 years old , has fostered an ethos of combat .
Mr. Smith 's managers have , at times , been called `` Ho Chi Minh 's Guerrillas . ''
Competitors are known as the `` enemy . ''
He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and , as a perk , fly free in empty cockpit seats .
And , with many of his 70,000 workers , Mr. Smith 's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on .
We do n't just hand the customer the package .
In essence , we run the show . ''
`` This is America , '' he says .
Such attitudes have given Federal flexibility , not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean .
But though couriers work as many as 60 hours a week during the autumn rush , they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck .
The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc. , the nation 's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members .
Because UPS drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot , say these couriers , packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late .
Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be , it also has brought problems .
Federal , on its own , had n't been doing very well overseas .
On routes to South America , the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were grounded .
These and other problems squeezed Federal 's profit margins last year to 8 % , down from more than 13 % annually in the first half of the decade .
In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31 , profit fell 54 % to $ 30.4 million , or 58 cents a share , mostly because of the Tiger merger , Federal says .
Since trading as low as $ 42.25 a share in May , Federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ 57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
There 's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase .
In the early 1970s , Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger 's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations .
Federal Express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually .
Until then , they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits .
Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers insubordination .
He then made most of the changes , pilots say .
Its 6,500 workers , who had battled Tiger 's management for years over givebacks , were union members until the day of the merger , when most of their unions were automatically decertified .
When the pilots refused , the company retracted it .
In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August , Mr. Smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago : that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be `` end-tailed '' -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules , pay and career options .
Mr. Smith is trying hard to allay the anger .
`` A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith , '' says J.X. Gollich , a Tiger-turned-Federal pilot and union activist .
Recently , they have appeared every few weeks in talk-show type videos , countering pro-union arguments .
He said Mr. Steinberg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly .
Furthermore , Mr. Smith added , `` our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice .
Already , the fight has been costly .
Meanwhile , the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists , and that is costing Federal `` a big number , '' says James Barksdale , executive vice president and chief operating officer .
`` They were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie , any resistance , '' says William Queenan , a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran .
Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote .
But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed , it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded .
Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties .
And for now , at least , the competition is n't the only enemy .
`` The pilots are either for us or extremely against us , '' he says with a sigh .
Harsco declined to say what country placed the order .
Delivery is to begin in early 1991 .
The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles , removing the 53-year-old judge from his $ 89,500-a-year , lifetime job .
In 1983 , Mr. Hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ 150,000 bribe in a case before him , the central charge on which the Senate convicted him .
With no floor debate , the Senate on Friday voted 69-26 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe , five votes more than needed .
He was found not guilty of three charges , involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive , government investigation .
Although Mr. Hastings had been acquitted by a jury , lawmakers handling the prosecution in Congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual .
Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll-call votes , then quickly left the chamber .
`` Their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers ' teaching regarding impeachment , '' Mr. Hastings said .
Mr. Hastings was appointed to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country .
Following the impeachment conviction , Dr. Benjamin Hooks , executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , issued a restrained statement , warning that the Hastings case could set a `` dangerous precedent , '' but adding , `` We must respect the considered judgment of the Senate .
What next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold ?
There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows -- and most of them had already made the fall lineup : a nun raising some lovable orphans .
A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards .
Week by week on `` Mancuso FBI '' -LRB- NBC , Fridays , 10 p.m . ET -RRB- , he pokes around the crime styles of the rich , famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI .
The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing -LRB- a la John Tower -RRB- .
Last week , a young black girl claimed she had been raped by a white police officer -LRB- a la Tawana Brawley -RRB- .
Along the way , we 're introduced to the supporting cast : a blond bombshell secretary -LRB- Randi Brazen -- her real name , honest -RRB- , a scheming young boss -LRB- Fredric Lehne -RRB- , another blonde bombshell who 's also an idealistic lawyer -LRB- Lindsay Frost -RRB- , and a forensics expert -LRB- Charles Siebert -RRB- .
In last week 's rape case , for example , the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest , and the biggest villains are the politicians who exploit the case . -RRB-
What makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard-bitten cynicism -- earned , we discover , when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s .
This is not the `` Mississippi Burning '' scenario that thrills his young colleagues : `` Kid , you 've been reading Classic Comics too long , '' Mancuso says .
Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover , and two cleaned his house . ''
He describes a reporter as `` Miss First Amendment . ''
And when he 's told `` Try a little tenderness , '' he shoots back `` I 'm going home to try a little linguine . ''
He 's the kind of guy who rescues trampled flags .
Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner -LRB- and Ken Solarz and Steve Bello -RRB- have revved this show up to the breaking point .
At least once an episode we see protestors marching around screaming slogans .
One more word and you are out on a park bench , mister . ''
In fact , throughout `` Mancuso FBI , '' we do n't get words or lines -- we get speeches .
And Mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs : `` How the hell can you live with yourself ? '' he erupts at a politician .
You built your career on prejudice and hate .
In each show , Mancuso gets to unleash similar harangues : `` Where the hell are they gon na live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump ?
And , at least once a show , someone delivers the line `` Get off that soapbox . ''
They have a series with a good character , some interesting , even occasionally surprising plot lines , and they 're ruining it .
It 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction , all to add more pizzazz to a script that 's already overdosing on pizzazz .
That 's not character .
There is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where Mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner David .
He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration , then turns and walks away .
There 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of `` Mancuso FBI . ''

Texaco Inc. has purchased an oil-producing company in Texas for $ 476.5 million , its first major acquisition since its legal brawl with Pennzoil Co. began more than four years ago .
Tana , which holds properties in 17 oil and gas fields in south Texas , will provide Texaco with mostly gas reserves .
`` This acquisition is another indication of Texaco 's commitment to increase the company 's reserve base , '' said Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear .
At least two years ago , the company put 60 million barrels of oil reserves on the block .
Not all of those parcels have yet been sold .
Texaco , like many other oil companies , has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves .
Pennzoil had sued Texaco for improperly interfering with its acquisition of a portion of Getty Oil Co .
Mr. Icahn , who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company , sold his stake in Texaco just last summer .
CRI Inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its Capital Housing and Mortgage Partners Inc. trust to between 71 cents and 74 cents a share , from between 75 cents and 80 cents , for the year ending June 9 , 1990 .
CRI , which sponsors Champs , is a world-wide real estate investment firm .
The figure was incorrectly shown as a net loss in a chart accompanying Friday 's Heard on the Street column .
Actually , Cervantes borrowed that quote from a writer of some 25 centuries earlier : Israel 's King Solomon wrote those words in the Book of Proverbs -LRB- 22:1 -RRB- .
Japan had an unadjusted trade surplus of $ 1.82 billion for the first 10 days of October , down from $ 3.16 billion a year earlier , the Finance Ministry said .
The report follows five-consecutive declines in full monthly figures .
Exports during the period were $ 7.01 billion , 2.6 % below $ 7.20 billion a year ago .
Amid heavy buying of shares in Belgium 's largest insurer , Maurice Lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight , in buying out a raider , could leave speculators with big losses on their AG stock .
The most likely white knight would be Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. , which already owns 18 % of AG and which itself is controlled by Cie . Financiere de Suez , the acquisitive French financial conglomerate .
AG is hardly alone in its anxiety .
Worried by European Community directives that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars .
In France , Suez and Axa-Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire , the sixth-largest European insurance company , after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle .
But he estimated that a raider would have been able to amass no more than 4 % of the shares in recent months .
They have all `` very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of AG , '' he said .
A `` syndicate '' of shareholders holds just under 50 % of AG , Mr. Lippens said , and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any AG shares .
A Generale spokesman confirmed that the giant Belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in AG should a raider seek control .
Even without bid talk , this year 's surge in prices for Brussels real estate has excited interest in AG .
With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama , one of the many lingering questions the Bush administration will ponder is this : Is the National Security Council staff big enough , and does it have enough clout , to do its job of coordinating foreign policy ?
Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission , which investigated the Iran-Contra affair .
So , following both the style he pursued as President Ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission , Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely , gathering the views of the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence community ; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out .
However , the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big , diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues .
`` It 's a very small shop . ''
The NSC staff `` does n't have the horsepower that I believe is required to have an effective interagency process , '' says Frank Gaffney , a former Pentagon aide who now runs the Center for Security Policy , a conservative Washington think-tank .
The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need , in an increasingly complex world , for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department , Pentagon and intelligence agencies .
In practice , the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members .
That task is one of Washington 's perennial problems .
Administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the Panama crisis .
He had just resigned , at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration 's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua 's Contra rebels .
Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy , Robert Gates , are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs .
Both have become confidants of President Bush .
In those areas , the role of NSC staffers under them therefore have become more important .
But just as every previous NSC adviser has , Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained .

Frank Lavelle , who at the time was the marketing director for Sperry in Clearwater , Fla. , admitted participating in a scheme to bribe Garland Tomlin , the Navy official .
The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985 , according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. Lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in Alexandria , Va .
Court documents filed by prosecutors indicate Mr. Tomlin tried to steer to Sperry a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment .
Sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work .
Charles Gardner , a former Unisys vice president , and James Neal , a former company consultant , have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes .
Mr. Lavelle faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $ 500,000 fine .
Seats are quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 asked .
Matthew Lesko , something of a professional defender of government , thought he had a sure-fire winner last summer when he offered $ 5,000 for the best `` verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you . ''
He plugged the contest on Larry King 's radio show , on Pat Sajak 's television show and on the C-SPAN cable television network .
Mr. Lesko figured he would be flooded with entries by now .
And in addition to the $ 5,000 , he has promised the winner a `` My Favorite Bureaucrat '' plaque and offered each of two runners-up $ 500 .
To make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat : A woman from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance who nominated her boss .
But he says he would prefer to get nominations from rank-and-file folks .
Newspapers , including this one , have generally ignored his news releases .
But Mr. Lesko 's staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest .
Mr. Lesko himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation .
`` Maybe people do n't believe I want to give this money away . ''
If he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something , Mr. Lesko admits , `` I 'd get 5,000 entries . ''
Ford Motor Co. and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after Ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return .
Saab , meanwhile , is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business .
Among the possible suitors is Italy 's Fiat S.p . A , analysts said last week .
Individuals close to the Ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology .
In addition , Ford and Saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations .
Some European analysts speculated that officials of Saab 's highly profitable Scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy .
Saab 's problems were underscored Friday when the company announced that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor -LRB- $ 186.1 million -RRB- loss during the first eight months of this year , slightly worse than Saab-Scania had forecast in its first-half report last month .
Industry analysts in Europe said the most likely suitor for Saab now is Fiat .
Last month , Saab-Scania Chief Executive Georg Karnsund said his company has had talks with Fiat about a broader alliance .
As for Ford , analysts expect the end of the Saab play will allow the U.S. auto maker to focus its resources on the intensifying struggle with GM for a stake in Jaguar .
Ford faces an uphill fight for Jaguar , however .
GM , meanwhile , is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker 's headquarter operations in Detroit .
But Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for , since the company 's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S .
So despite the GM-Jaguar romance , analysts say Ford by last Friday had boosted its Jaguar holding to about 11 % of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from 10.4 % early last week .
On the U.S. over-the-counter market , Jaguar 's American depositary receipts rose 12.5 cents to $ 11.125 .
The Dallas Cowboys are looking at a long-yardage situation , struggling to pull ahead of the Atlanta Falcons .
Mr. Jones takes heart .
So key , in fact , that Mr. Jones signed him in April for $ 11.4 million over the next six years -- a record for a rookie .
With three minutes left on the clock , Mr. Aikman takes the snap , steps back and fires a 21-yard pass -- straight into the hands of an Atlanta defensive back .
A few days after that Sept. 17 game , Mr. Aikman broke a finger , sidelining him for weeks .
For Mr. Jones , losing his quarterback temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has beset the Dallas Cowboys -- and , this year , much of the National Football League .
Last year , the team ended up $ 2 million in the red on $ 30 million in revenue .
Its attendance is off 23 % from six years ago .
Nearly half the owners of the 28 National Football League teams are losing money , the result of flat attendance , aging stadiums and -- more than anything -- skyrocketing salaries for star players like Mr. Aikman .
First-round draft picks have done even better : Average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ 685,000 this year , up 44 % from 1987 .
`` One team pays so much and the other pays more .
All this is causing convulsions in professional football .
Though not intentionally , the Cowboys ' Mr. Jones has come to represent this new breed of owner .
First , he unceremoniously sacked Tom Landry , the legendary coach who took the Cowboys to five Super Bowls and 20 consecutive winning seasons .
Anti-Jones sentiment flooded the local press : `` A crude obnoxious hick , '' said one writer ; `` a real oink , '' said another ; `` Who in the hell does he think he is ? '' wrote a third .
He quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half , shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and , in July , announced plans to sell Valley Ranch , the team 's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL .
It is a maze of halls that connects film rooms , elaborate spas and weight-training centers that testify to a richer , more free-spending era .
`` I said , ` Somebody come get me .
With a new day dawning on the sport , Mr. Jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury .
The place costs nearly $ 2 million a year to maintain .
And as for Tom Landry , well , in Mr. Jones 's mind , he had played out his winning years .
Football has long been Mr. Jones 's passion , both on and off the field .
After college , he worked at his father 's insurance company in Little Rock , and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the San Diego Chargers .
So it was n't surprising that Mr. Jones returned to his Arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for Mr. Landry .
Whatever Mr. Johnson 's talents , in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans , he is no Tom Landry .
In fact , the last time they played this badly was in 1960 , their opening season .
Mr. Jones is attacking the problem on several fronts .
To try to draw more fans , he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from $ 25 to $ 19 .
`` It 's simple , '' says Lamar Hunt , who owns the Kansas City Chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ 2.40 to an average $ 17 .
Mr. Jones has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping Texas Stadium -LRB- his deal with Bum Bright included operating rights for the stadium -RRB- .
Mr. Jones has been taking prospective suite owners onto the field during practice to let them rub elbows with players , and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time .
Today , 30 have .
The biggest is the NFL 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games .
The team additionally earns between $ 2 million and $ 4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights .
He is also trying to get more stations in Mexico , where the Cowboys have a following , to pick up the games .
He calls the contracts `` critical to winning in the NFL '' and has played his part in the bidding wars .
This wage inflation is bleeding the NFL dry , the owners contend .
To tackle the problem , NFL owners have proposed setting a rookie wage scale to try to rein in salaries .
Bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance .
The owners are trying to boost profit in other ways , too .
Most of the owners must pay up to 10 % of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old .
`` We have the worst lease in the NFL , '' contends Michael B. McCaskey , the president of the Chicago Bears and a grandson of George Halas , who founded the NFL 's predecessor organization .
When the lease expires in 1999 , he says , `` It 's got to be changed . ''
And the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract , which expires after this season .
Owners say they expect the league to demand a 50 % increase , despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings .
The changes have n't come easy .
The new breed of team owner , Mr. Jones included , has been fighting the NFL bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs , and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock .
Mr. Finks is perceived by some owners as a standard-bearer for the Old Guard .
The owners meet again tomorrow .
He puts in busy six-day weeks -LRB- excluding game days -RRB- , and on one recent afternoon fielded questions , in the course of an hour , from a TV producer , his luxury-suite marketing manager , a disgruntled customer and a roomful of Arkansas reporters .
`` When I made this investment , I made it on a lifetime basis , '' he explains .
While the Cowboys may not be the best investment now , I do n't accept they ca n't be in the future . ''
Owning the Cowboys has bought him entree to a glitzy life that drilling for oil in Arkansas just did n't provide .
A few weeks ago , Mr. Jones even entertained Elizabeth Taylor in his private suite at Texas Stadium .
How interestingly clever of Robert Goldberg to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of `` Days of Rage '' in his television critique -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept 11 -RRB- .
Was not the title very clear ?
Really now , did she have to ask ?
Mr. Goldberg contends that even as `` propaganda '' the film fails because it presents only one view .
But his complaint that `` Days of Rage '' does n't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant .
This film did emphasize how long the stalemate has existed by tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without specifying how it was to be done .
Every issue is multisided .
Now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only .
President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week .
If the request is approved by both the House and Senate , Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget to move the money , according to Senate budget analysts .
`` It 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs , '' said Chairman James Sasser -LRB- D. , Tenn . -RRB- of the Senate Budget Committee , who said he would oppose the request .
The president 's request did n't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money .
Last week , Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $ 16.1 billion spending reduction , half of which must come from defense , to `` impose a little bit more discipline '' by applying cuts to each individual program , project or activity in the budget .
Under the deficit-reduction law , 4.3 % of the Pentagon 's money and 5.3 % of other agencies ' money has been canceled .
Rochester Telephone Corp. said it completed its purchase of Urban Telephone Corp. , of Clintonville , Wis. , the second-largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state .

A bill that would permit the Securities and Exchange Commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms , which argue that the legislation is unnecessary .
Richard Breeden , the new chairman of the SEC , has n't taken a formal position on the bill , which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies .
The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions .
But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted .
First Boston , whose holding company , CS First Boston Group , is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street , said it is also concerned that once the SEC has the power to monitor holding companies , it will try to regulate their activities .
The bill would `` divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker-dealers into areas which simply have no way of affecting broker-dealers , '' Mr. Raoul-Duval said .
An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded to the language in the bill . ''
Mr. O'Brien will elaborate on the SIA 's position in testimony before the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee this week , a spokesman said .
I 've organized a series of exchanges , exhibitions and other continuing projects between Cuban and American artists .
Despite levels of obstruction , incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion , these projects all remain , in my mind , valuable and well worth the effort .
Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate .
In fact , the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara 's famous linkages of art idealism and revolution seem modest .
The Ochoa trial in July , with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption , and the summary trial and execution , was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of Cuba .
Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel , the army and the Cuban people .
It is naivete to equate a government 's policies with the will of the people -LRB- as we well know -RRB- , and it is even worse folly to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy .
I think it 's a little disingenuous to be surprised that Fidel does n't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory .
Without this basic level of attention to reality , our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years .
There is no rational justification for such behavior .
ENGRAPH INC. recently reported third-quarter earnings , which were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in last Tuesday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates .
Engraph 's third-quarter net income of 15 cents a share actually was 7 % higher than the adjusted average of estimates .
One bond trader estimated that more than $ 50 million of New York City general obligation bonds were put up for sale Friday alone .
`` I 've never seen so many -LCB- New York City -RCB- G.O. 's up for sale , '' said another trader .
Municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health , rumors of a $ 900 million bond offering coming soon , and political uncertainty .
General obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit . -RRB-
The fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that New York 's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected .
There have been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening , as the October 1987 stock market crash continues to make itself felt .
Meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding .
The weakness in New York City bonds follows a warning from New York state Comptroller Edward Regan that the 1987 crash seriously weakened the city 's economy .
Mr. Regan warned mayoral candidates `` to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city 's problems in the next few years , due to the now-evident weakening in the New York City economy . ''
At present , analysts project a budget gap on the order of $ 500 million to $ 600 million for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990 , although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit .
He charges the city 's critics with spreading `` unfounded emotional rhetoric . ''
The leading contender for the mayoral office , Democrat David Dinkins , has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs .
Until last week , Mr. Dinkins was considered a shoo-in .
Until last week , `` Everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election .
Last week , yields on long-term New York City general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point .
As the yield on New York general obligation bonds rose , the Bond Buyer 20-bond general obligation index , the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market , held steady at 7.19 % in the week ended Oct. 19 .
Qintex Entertainment also said David Evans , its president and chief executive , and Roger Kimmel , a director , both resigned .
Earlier this month , Qintex Australia 's $ 1.5 billion agreement to acquire Communications Co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ 50 million letter of credit the Australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction .
Qintex Entertainment , a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its co-production of the hit miniseries `` Lonesome Dove , '' said it filed for Chapter 11 protection after Qintex Australia failed to provide it with $ 5.9 million owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of `` The New Leave It to Beaver Show . ''
After the announcement of the bankruptcy filing , Qintex Entertainment stock sank $ 2.625 in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 1.50 on heavy volume of more than 1.4 million shares .
Jonathan Lloyd , executive vice president and chief financial officer of Qintex Entertainment , said Qintex Entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with MCA .
Mr. Lloyd said if Qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ 92 million in debt under its loan agreements .
Qintex Australia was `` saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation .
`` We were reassured they would stand behind the company . ''
At that point , he said , Qintex Australia stated it would `` endeavor to arrange '' the financing .
In a prepared statement from Australia , the company also said that , following the breakdown of the MGM talks , it `` had been re-evaluating its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of Qintex Entertainment '' and had `` resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to Qintex Entertainment in excess of that previously made . ''
He said the company believed Qintex Entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means .
`` It 's a shocker , '' said Joseph Di Lillo , chairman of Drake Capital Securities , a brokerage firm that has an investment in Qintex Entertainment .
Qintex said Mr. Evans , the former president , resigned for `` personal reasons '' and that Mr. Kimmel , an attorney , resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying was no longer necessary .
The announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between Qintex Australia and might be revived .
However , `` we are n't currently doing anything .
Financial printer Bowne & Co. said it formed a business translation service , which will provide legal , financial and other services in most major languages , including Japanese , Chinese and Russian .
Makoto Utsumi , vice minister for international affairs , said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to Japanese banks that they stay out of the UAL Corp. leveraged buy-out .
`` There are no facts -LCB- behind the assertions -RCB- that we sent any kind of signal , '' he declared in an interview .
A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another .
The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was `` being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress '' and it was `` necessary for us to grasp the situation . ''
Mr. Utsumi also said some Japanese banks were willing to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end , which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out .
`` Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that -LCB- UAL -RCB- deal , '' he said .
It 's a sound phenomenon . ''
A Sanwa Bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision .
Still , Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks .
Bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about Japanese banks getting in over their heads .
`` The -LCB- ministry -RCB- wants to see the Japanese banks pull in their horns '' on leveraged buy-outs , he added .
Japanese banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , the analyst said .
Clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs .
Despite Mr. Sumita 's statements , it is the Finance Ministry , not the central bank , that makes policy decisions .
Despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for Japanese banks to increase their presence in the U.S. market , bank analysts say .
Jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to leapfrog the problem of not having a strong retail-banking network .
Concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products , it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes , but also into electronic car-parking payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores .
`` We are n't Philip Morris Cos. , '' says Bertrand de Galle , chairman of government-owned Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A. , known as Seita .
-LRB- Last year , for example , Seita 's net profit soared 150 % to 461.6 million French francs -LRB- $ 73.5 million -RRB- on sales of FFr27.68 billion-a 1.7 % profit margin . -RRB-
While Seita does n't own the French tabacs , its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities .
Instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines , which deliver little paper receipts , drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops .
When the motorist returned to his car he could turn the card off and , if it showed time remaining , save it for later .
Seita and Matra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service .
It wanted to buy RJR Nabisco Inc. 's French cracker subsidiary , Belin , in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores , but lost the bidding to food group BSN SA .
And it retains an interest in acquiring candies and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops .
Brown-tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises now make up just 40 % of the French tobacco market , half the level of about two decades ago .
So Seita has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label , and intends to relaunch the unsuccessful Gitanes Blondes in new packaging , similar to the slide-packs used by brown-tobacco Gitanes .
When the Supreme Court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions last July , the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving , trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds .
The decision , Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services , illustrates how Supreme Court rulings often have a ripple effect , spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices .
The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the Constitution .
But the Supreme Court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services .
Already , local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services , an abortion clinic in St. Louis .
Under a 1981 Missouri law , persons accused of some crimes , including trespassing , may offer a defense that their actions were justified `` as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury . ''
In another case , a protester , Ann O'Brien , was convicted of trespass before the Supreme Court 's Webster ruling .
`` The effect of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs. Wade , and I think this is one of the cracks , '' said Mark Belz , a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters .
Mario Mandina , president of Kansas City Lawyers for Life , says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass , `` This will shut down abortion in Missouri .
That would be an ironic result of a case in which the Supreme Court expressly stopped short of overruling Roe vs. Wade .
In one , the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of Columbia , Mo. , who was charged with drunk driving , argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception , not from birth .
A Boone County judge rejected the motion , but Daniel Dodson , a Jefferson City lawyer , says he has appealed .
In terms of sheer brutality , the Somali regime of Siad Barre may rank as No. 1 in the world .
The Barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people it can torture and kill .
Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of the behavior of President Barre 's troops .
Guns were never used : Each man was stabbed to death with a large knife .
The study was done by Robert Gersony , a consultant to the U.S. State Department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the left-right ideological divide .
Not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks .
Mutinies wrack his armed forces -LRB- really just an armed gang -RRB- , which control less than half the country .
Desperate , he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north , which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of Mogadishu .
The U.S. 's interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera , which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean .
In the past two years , the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to Mr. Barre 's brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control .
But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway .
Recently , in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia , Tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops .
Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa , threatening the town of Dese , which would cut off Mr. Mengistu 's capital from the port of Assab , through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis Ababa .
Mr. Mengistu is in an increasingly weak position : Half his army is tied down defending the northern city of Asmara from the Eritreans .
While the Tigreans are communists , like the Eritreans they are among the most anti-Soviet guerrillas in the world , having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the Soviet-supplied Mengistu air force .
The U.S. , therefore , has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa .
What 's more , the U.S. has suspended $ 2.5 million in military aid and $ 1 million in economic aid .
Because the U.S. is still perceived to be tied to Mr. Barre , when he goes the runway could go too .
It is a certainty that Mr. Barre 's days are numbered .
Nobody is sure what will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be .
While the State Department positions itself for the post-Barre period in Somalia , it should continue to back former President Carter 's well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia , while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan .
Remember that it took Mr. Mengistu many months , in what became known as the `` creeping coup , '' to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975 .
But the U.S. has one great advantage : The Soviets are universally loathed throughout Ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all .
The only U.S. liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. Barre , and that should be cut fast .

But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if OPEC does n't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters .
The organization is scheduled to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25 .
But that could change if demand for OPEC 's oil softens seasonally early next year as some think may happen .
At that rate , a majority of OPEC 's 13 members have reached their output limits , they said .
Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries , including his own , Issam Al-Chalabi , Iraq 's oil minister , told the conference Friday .
That 's higher than some other estimates .
Either way , the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge .
The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market .
Under that approach , countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC 's production ceiling than they would under the current system .
At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month , OPEC 's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling .
The main effect of the ceiling boost was to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters .
Previously , no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target , or ceiling .
In the end politics got in the way .
And the United Arab Emirates , a chronic quota cheater , refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways .
It 's understood several compromises already have been worked into the plan .
Libya 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem , although the United Arab Emirates is still an issue .
Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members .
Some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on Saudi Arabia to `` give back '' to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels .
Mr. Nazer , the Saudi oil minister , reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions .
In a blow to France 's Rafale jet fighter , the French navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy 15 McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-18 Hornets to defend its aircraft carriers .
In an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine Cols Bleus , the navy 's second-in-command , Adm. Yves Goupil , said the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century .
Adm. Goupil said the navy ca n't wait until 1998 , when the naval Rafale becomes available , to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders , used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack .
Officially , the statement is n't an attack on the Rafale .
But unofficially , senior navy officials sharply criticize the Rafale as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use .
Adm. Goupil 's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of Dassault .
The Rafale project is the result of France 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries , and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs .
What brought the naval issue to a head is that the Crusaders are literally falling apart , without any immediate plan to replace them .
A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here .
Even modernized , he said , the Crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers France has sent to meet such crises as the wars in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf .

Spending by average Japanese households in August fell an adjusted 1.9 % from a year earlier , the Statistics Bureau of the Prime Minister 's Office said .
Spending by Japanese households averaged 290,782 yen -LRB- $ 2,052.10 -RRB- in August .
August adjusted spending by wage-earning families was down 0.6 % to 309,381 yen from a year earlier .
For Cathay Pacific Airways , the smooth ride may be ending .
Securities analysts , many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing Cathay 's interim figures , believe more jolts lie ahead .
In addition , delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 Boeing 747-400s that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes .
There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China 's sovereignty in 1997 , Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China 's often-disparaged flag carrier , Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC .
Sarah Hall , an analyst at James Capel -LRB- Far East -RRB- Ltd. , says there is n't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel , Hong Kong 's tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar .
Ms. Hall expects Cathay 's profit to grow around 13 % annually this year and next .
Cathay is taking several steps to bolster business .
In addition to aircraft from Boeing Co. , Cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 Airbus A330-300s .
The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay 's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights , while the Boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to Europe and North America .
Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay 's labor costs by 20 % a year for low-level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain .
David Bell , a spokesman for the airline , says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997 .
Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights , Cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors .
There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government 's plans to build a new airport , with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal .
Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay 's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay 's strategy .
Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .
`` But we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's .
In a pattern it aims to copy in several key U.S. destinations , Cathay recently announced plans to serve San Francisco by flying into American Airlines ' Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U.S. carrier .
`` But this way , American will coordinate good extensions to Boston , New York , Chicago and Dallas .
Asian traffic , which currently accounts for 65 % of Cathay 's business , is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay .
Further expansion into southern Europe is also possible , says Mr. Bell , the spokesman .
And Mr. Eddington emphatically rules out a move to London : `` Our lifeblood is Hong Kong traffic rights . ''
A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for Hong Kong 's airlines , which include the smaller Hong Kong Dragon Airlines , will continue to be negotiated by Hong Kong 's government .
`` My feeling is -LCB- Cathay does n't -RCB- have a hope in the long run , '' says an analyst , who declines to be identified .
Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes , but he feels that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future .
Falcon Cable Systems Co. said it proposed an amendment that would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65 % of the company 's fair market value from the 40 % currently allowed .
A spokesman for the company said a meeting would be held for shareholders to vote on the amendment before year 's end .

In the hard-hit Marina neighborhood , life after the earthquake is often all too real , but sometimes surreal .
Saturday night she dined in an emergency shelter on salmon steaks prepared by chefs from one of the city 's four-star restaurants .
A couple in fashionable spandex warm-up suits jogs by , headphones jauntily in place , weaving their way along a street of fractured and fallen houses .
A policeman shakes his head in amazement as he steers them away .
She is told she ca n't enter unless she is accompanied by an inspector .
Nearby , five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on stools , having their necks and backs kneaded by volunteer masseuses .
In addition to free massages , there was free counseling , phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club , which offered up its showers , saunas and hot tubs .
`` This has been a 15-pound earthquake for me , '' said resident Joan O'Shea , who works in an acupuncturist 's office .
She finds the response of Marina residents -- primarily yuppies and elderly people -- to the devastation of their homes `` incredible .
I do n't know if this would have happened somewhere else . ''
`` It 's so weird to have to decide what 's really important to you , '' said Barbara May .
In post-earthquake parlance , her building is a `` red . ''
Green allowed residents to re-enter ; yellow allowed limited access ; red allowed residents one last entry to gather everything they could within 15 minutes .
Some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases , others threw goods out windows .
`` The guys are going for their skis , their stereos , their personal computers , '' said Frank Fitzgerald , who helped others empty their apartments .
He showed an unbroken , still-ticking pocket watch that he retrieved for one woman .
Some residents defied orders and returned to `` red '' buildings to retrieve goods .
A policewoman had to be called in to make her leave ; the policewoman helped carry out one last load .
One man trying to remove his car was told by officials to get out of his garage .
The Marina also has become the focal point of city efforts to reunite residents with any pets that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake .
The San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also has been providing medical care , food , water and foster homes for quake-displaced animals .
For example , one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment , like many others in the Marina , did n't have heat .
A warm foster home has been found .
But turn into the shopping center 's parking lot , and one could be in the safe , busy mall of a prosperous suburb .
Over the past year there have been only one burglary , three thefts of or from autos , no purse-snatchings , and one attempted robbery in the mall , which opened in late 1981 .
The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $ 350 per leasable square foot ; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ 200 .
A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern , in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth , gangs , and the criminal element , with an erosion of the customer base , development capital , and insurability .
Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents .
This defensible commercial zone becomes , for the residents , a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape , evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible .
An additional benefit is the creation of jobs .
It continues through the life of the center ; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ 2,500 per job .
And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales , real estate , licenses and the like .
Bradford Crowe , director of the mayor 's City Economic Development Office , says : `` There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood .
Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women .
Children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins .
Primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time , patience , breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess .
One of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies , local political leaders , and citizen groups , and with prospective tenants and sources of financing .
Security at a typical Haagen inner-city center is impressive , but unobtrusive .
Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance .
The security command post , camouflaged as second-story retail space , has its own `` crow 's nest '' above the roofs of the other buildings , with a panoramic view of the entire center .
These features are also used in Matanky Realty Group 's Grand Boulevard Plaza .
Security is 60 % to 70 % of the common area charges of these centers , vs. an industry average of about 15 % .
Many of these programs no longer exist , or have been severely cut back .
Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that combines tax incentives , loans , and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities .
Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date .
New approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets .
Government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit Vermont-Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves .

The company said the approximately $ 115 million acquisition price includes its total $ 33 million of long-term debt outstanding .
PSE is a designer and operator of energy-cogeneration facilities and had 1988 sales of $ 234 million .
The company said recently it expects third-quarter earnings will be in range from $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share , compared with $ 326,000 , or four cents a share , a year ago .
Some stock pickers already are targeting the OTC market , where , they say , await plenty of small - and medium-sized growth stocks .
Growth stocks will return to favor , some analysts and money managers think , because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on Oct. 13 , and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements .
`` The market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth , '' declares Mary Farrell , a PaineWebber analyst .
Like many OTC growth issues , they have market values -- as measured by stock price times shares outstanding -- of roughly $ 100 million to $ 500 million .
These are sometimes dubbed `` emerging '' growth companies , though they also have expanding-profit track records .
That 's an important distinction because some analysts and brokers , who perennially predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues , may use any spurt in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks .
Mr. Palicka 's picks from the OTC market include Legent , Mail Boxes Etc. , and Payco American .
`` If the market refocuses on earnings , we should get better valuations of growth stocks , '' says L. Keith Mullins , a growth-stock analyst at Morgan Stanley .
In anticipation of that shift , he and other analysts are encouraging their clients to buy such issues now .
The average issue on Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index gained 35 % last year , Ms. Farrell of PaineWebber says .
In addition , earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow , restructuring and takeover potential , and breakup value as the preferred stock-picking standards for much of the year .
As a result , Morgan Stanley 's Index of 40 Emerging Growth Stocks -- most of which are in the OTC market -- is up only 13 % for the year , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has leaped 24 % and the S&P 500 has grown 25 % .
Some investors are skeptical of growth stocks because investing in them means ignoring that maxim found in the fine print of some investment advertisements -- that past performance is n't indicative of future results .
Among his favorites in his firm 's index are Legent , Silicon Graphics and Novell .
Mark Schoeppner , portfolio manager at Pittsburgh-based Quaker Capital Management , says that in reaction to nervousness about debt-laden buy-out transactions , analysts and investors now appear to be `` valuing stock based on future earnings as opposed to the amount of debt the company can support . ''

On Friday , Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp said it expects a net loss of $ 16 million for the third quarter of 1989 because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit .
First Interstate took a huge $ 350 million provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank .
First Interstate made the move under pressure from regulators .
Earlier last week , Valley National Corp. , the state 's largest locally owned banking company , reported a $ 72.2 million loss and suspended its dividend .
Security Pacific Corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ 109 million , mainly because of sour Arizona real-estate loans .
Furthermore , the regulatory maneuvering behind First Interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future Arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it .
When First Interstate balked , arguing that the figure was too high , regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ 350 million .
Thomas P. Marrie , chief financial officer , would n't comment about the details of the negotiations .
The tough regulatory stance portends large future losses , especially at the state 's thrifts .
For example , Western Savings & Loan Association , which is now in conservatorship , had tangible capital-assets minus liabilities -- of a negative $ 357.4 million at June 30 .
Yet it still held $ 916.3 million of repossessed real estate , for which it maintains no reserves whatsoever .
The rapid deterioration of the Arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout , officially estimated at about $ 166 billion .
They have no reserves against the real estate , and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up .
Other lenders have been recovering only 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar on foreclosed Arizona property , if they can sell it at all .
In the late 1970s and early 1980s , lenders and developers poured money into office buildings , condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land , confident that Arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of 4 % to 6 % for years to come .
`` It 's horrible to say , but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in Phoenix -- it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings , '' said C.W. Jackson , a prominent Arizona businessman with interests in real estate , banking and many other businesses .
Ralph Shattuck , publisher of Foreclosure Update newsletter , said foreclosures have climbed to about 1,482 a month just in Maricopa County , where Phoenix is located .
`` It 's frightening , '' Mr. Shattuck said .
And the generally frail condition of Arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide .
`` We 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end .
First Interstate had a $ 214.4 million loss in 1988 's third quarter , mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its Texas operations .
The bank 's Arizona unit holds about $ 6 billion of First Interstate 's $ 50 billion of assets .
Some in Arizona think that may be optimistic .
First Interstate stock closed at $ 57.625 , down 25 cents , in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange .
Mr. Marrie said the problems in Arizona have only `` increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective . ''
S&P also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company 's principal unit , Valley National Bank of Arizona .
A spokesman for Phoenix , Ariz.-based Valley National , said the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in Arizona real estate .
Immunex Corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma .
IL-4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response .
But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction .
The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by Receptech Corp. , a spinoff of Immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial public offering .
Immunex will have the option to buy back Receptech shares after five years .

Conner dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers .
Its revenue totaled $ 184.4 million , an increase of 172 % from $ 67.8 million a year ago .
Revenue nearly tripled to $ 479 million , from $ 160 million .
That 's a faster growth rate than reported by Compaq , which did n't post similar results until its fourth year , in 1986 .
Conner 's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers , the computer industry 's fastest-growing segment .
Today , Conner controls an estimated 90 % of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers .
`` They 've had this field to themselves for over a year now , and they 've been greatly rewarded , '' said Bob Katsive , an analyst at Inc. , a market researcher in Los Altos , Calif .
Next month , Seagate Technology , which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers , plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers .
`` They are going to catch up , '' said David Claridge , an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist .
But Conner is n't standing still .
Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of power and one weighs just 5.5 ounces .
`` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can . ''
`` We 're not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition , '' he said .
Last week , for instance , Compaq introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews .
From its inception , Conner has targeted the market for battery-operated machines , building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as Seagate .
Conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to Compaq , which as of July owned 40 % of Conner 's stock .
Move over , pornographic phone services : A legal service with a `` 900 '' number has been launched in California .
Cane & Associates touts its $ 2-a-minute service as the `` cheapest legal hour you 'll ever find . ''
He says his aim is to reach people who are bedridden , have no access to transportation , ca n't find a lawyer to take their case or simply ca n't afford lawyers ' consultation fees .
`` We will only deal with clients on the phone , '' he says .
Telelawyer is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit .
There also are `` 800 '' hotlines which refer people to lawyers , usually personal-injury specialists , for in-office consultation .
In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue , Cane lawyers review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers .
If the matter requires further legal work or litigation , Mr. Cane says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm .
So far , says Mr. Cane , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions .
Out of the $ 2 charge , the law firm pockets about $ 1.55 .
A federal court jury in New York found U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- and his wife , Jane Lee Garcia , guilty of extorting $ 76,000 from Wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman .
The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments , some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from Mrs. Garcia .
Edward J.M. Little , one of the assistant U.S. attorneys who prosecuted the case , said the Garcia trial `` is the last of the Wedtech prosecutions . ''
Lawyers for the Garcias said they plan to appeal .
`` In the next few weeks , I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents , '' said Mr. Garcia , 56 years old .
The Garcias were cleared of four other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities .
FIVE SHEA & GOULD PARTNERS are leaving to form a new firm .
The five partners who resigned from Shea & Gould late last week are Tom Hutton , Sam Ingram , Dean Yuzek , Daniel Carroll and Ernest Bertolotti .
Howard Rubenstein , a New York publicist who represents Shea & Gould , said , `` Shea & Gould understands they 're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of . ''
He said Shea & Gould held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their own firm .
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS against lawyers open to public in Illinois .
The actual disciplinary hearings will be public .
Non-lawyers will be added to the inquiry panels that look into allegations of misconduct .
One vocal critic of the changes , Chicago lawyer Warren Lupel , says non-lawyers should n't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships .
Nevertheless , Mr. Lupel anticipates no legal action to reverse the Illinois Supreme Court 's decision to institute the changes .

DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to Delaware , the 26th state to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges .
The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states .
Philip Morris Cos. , whose Benson & Hedges cigarette brand has been losing market share , has asked at least one other agency to try its hand at creative work for the big account , which has been at Wells Rich Greene Inc. since 1966 .
Several executives said another potential contender is WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather agency , which works on some other Philip Morris products .
A spokeswoman for Ogilvy & Mather said the agency does n't comment on `` idle speculation . ''
The loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to Wells Rich .
The account billed almost $ 60 million last year , according to Leading National Advertisers .
Industry executives said Philip Morris had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand 's slipping market share .
The brand is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business , Mr. Maxwell said .
That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing .
The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some analysts believe is partly responsible for its staid performance .
Wells Rich Greene , however , in an effort directed by Mary Wells Lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business .
While Wells Rich recently picked up Hertz Corp. 's $ 25 million to $ 30 million account , it has lost a number of big accounts this year , including the $ 20 million to $ 25 million Cadbury-Schweppes Canada Dry and Sunkist accounts , the $ 18 million Procter & Gamble Co . Sure deodorant account and the $ 10 million Lauren business .
This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week 's earthquake .
The Bay Bridge , the main artery into San Francisco from the east , will be closed for at least several weeks .
The bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day .
The Bay Area Rapid Transit system , which runs subway trains beneath the bay , is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000 .
Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the East Bay towns of Oakland and Berkeley .
The Red and White Fleet , which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County , and tourist tours of the bay , is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $ 10 round-trip .
`` I 'll stay with BART , '' said one secretary , swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube .
`` We 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , '' said one official .
About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period .
It also raised hackles of the city 's tourism boosters .
City officials stuck by their estimate of $ 2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city .
All estimates exclude highway repair , which could exceed $ 1 billion .
The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the Embarcadero Freeway .
Engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the Embarcadero structure .
The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that `` we were incredibly lucky , '' said Lawrence Kornfield , San Francisco 's chief building inspector .
City building codes require construction that can resist temblors .
`` The extent of the claims wo n't be known for some time , '' Mr. Leach said .
California officials plan to ask Congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans .
Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief .

Bond Corp. has interests in brewing , media and communications , natural resources and property .
The results included a A$ 453.4 million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of A$ 149.5 million on the sale of a stake of about 20 % in Lonrho PLC .
Earnings before interest and tax from brewing dived 50 % to A$ 123.8 million from A$ 247.3 million .
Bond Corp. 's shares closed Friday before news of the results at 28 Australian cents a share , up one Australian cent .
Only a year ago , the chairman of Bond Corp. , who controls about 58 % of the company , appeared to be building a war chest to attack some big companies .
It has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block .
We 've taken it on the chin .
Bond Corp. signaled it will focus on building its domestic and international media and communications businesses .
The result `` will ultimately be a very different group in size and structure , '' Bond Corp. directors said in a statement .
Bond Corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 Australian cents a share , vs. positive asset backing of A$ 1.92 a share a year ago .
Indeed , in a note to the results , directors said if the `` true worth '' of some of the group 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values , the negative net asset backing a share would turn into `` a substantial positive '' one .
The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs .
The business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers .
In his first year of operating the store he bought for $ 220,000 , Mr. Ortiz was robbed at least twice at gunpoint .
The second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged .
That was his reward for working until 11 p.m. seven days a week to cover his $ 3,000 a month rent .

The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2 % of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door-to-door salespeople .
Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem .
While by no means the highest crime community in the country , New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development .
It gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses .
Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed .
More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises .
Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average .
Two decades ago , the Small Business Administration reported Yale Prof. Albert Reiss 's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national IRS records .
The New York study 's companies averaged 27 employees ; their annual crime losses averaged about $ 15,000 , with an additional $ 8,385 annual cost in security -- enough money to hire at least one more worker .
Whatever the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury .
One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises .
Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents .
This may help explain why small businesses create 65 % of all jobs nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York .
The New York study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 per worker , compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees .
Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places .
Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants .
This creates several problems .
The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents .
A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses .
Some cities , including New York , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses .
Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas .
Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density .
Small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect .
It might even have saved the life , and business , of Israel Ortiz .
ENFIELD Corp. said in Toronto that it hopes to raise 56 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 47.7 million -RRB- through a rights offering to shareholders .

Diversification pays .
Stock funds , like the market as a whole , generally dropped more than 2 % in the week through last Thursday , according to figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc .
But several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market 's slide .
`` More than ever , people should realize they should have a diversified portfolio , '' said Jeremy Duffield , a senior vice president of Vanguard Group .
One week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision .
`` You want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered , '' said Kurt Brouwer , an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco .
What you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car going to perform ? ''
But Lipper Analytical 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock market 's gyrations .
Flexible portfolio funds , which allocate investments among stocks , bonds and money-market instruments and other investments , declined at about half the rate of stock funds -- an average drop of 1.27 % , according to Lipper .
This gives them the added benefits of international diversification -- including a foreign-exchange boost during periods , like the past week , when the dollar declines against other major currencies .
But while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough , there 's also a price to pay : A diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot .
Thus , even including the latest week , the average general stock fund has soared more than 24 % so far this year , the Lipper Analytical figures show .
Fixed-income funds have returned 8.2 % , while gold funds , which tend to be volatile , have risen just 4.55 % , on average .
You do n't make any real money . ''
Some equity funds did better than others in the week that began on Friday the 13th .
Its return so far this year has been a credible 21.71 % .
By the time the market plummeted 10 days ago , Monetta was 55 % in cash , said Robert Bacarella , president and portfolio manager .
Among Mr. Bacarella 's picks : Oracle Systems , Reebok International Ltd. and Digital Microwave Corp .
Among the big stock funds , Dreyfus Fund , with more than $ 2 billion in assets , had a decline of just 1.49 % for the week and a return of 21.42 % for the year .
`` In a downward market , bonds act better , '' he said .
We believe interest rates will continue to trend lower , and the economy will slow around the world . ''
From its high point on Thursday , Oct. 12 , to where it traded late in New York a week later , the dollar fell 3.6 % against the West German mark , 3.4 % against the British pound and 2.1 % against the Japanese yen .
Because the funds ' investments are denominated in foreign currencies , their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar .
All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date .
Reflecting airline takeover activity , however , both the Fidelity Select Air Transportation Portfolio and the National Aviation & Technology fund posted better-than-average returns for the the year to date : 30.09 % for the Fidelity Air Transportation fund and a whopping 47.24 % for National Aviation & Technology .
Noting that equity funds are up nearly 60 % from their post-crash low on Dec. 3 , 1987 , he said that what happened last week `` may not be enough of an adjustment .
But investors do n't seem to think so .
Vanguard Group said it had a more than $ 50 million net inflow into its stock funds last week .
People showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities . ''

After years of relative obscurity , he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture .
He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant -- `` architecturally impeccable , '' Progressive Architecture magazine called it -- and his remodeling of Paul Stuart , the Madison Avenue clothing store .
He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts .
Now the question is : Is Poland ready for it ?
The project has already acquired a certain New York cachet .
Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS .
If Mr. McDonough 's plans get executed , as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum , steel and glass recycled from Warsaw 's abundant rubble .
Solar-powered batteries will make the spire glow .
The carpets wo n't be glued down , and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes .
If Mr. McDonough has his way , the Poles will compensate for the trade center 's emissions of carbon dioxide , a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear .
The news has n't exactly moved others in Mr. McDonough 's profession to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds .
Karen Nichols , senior associate at Michael Graves 's architecture firm in Princeton , N.J. , says : `` We 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily . ''
The son of a Seagram 's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world , Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights , Ohio , before entering Dartmouth College .
His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth .
Living in Hong Kong , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies .
He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont .
Mr. McDonough 's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York .
Since the 1970s energy crisis , some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect : high indoor pollution .

Its developer is a Polish American , Sasha Muniak .
The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment , not readily accessible in Poland now , for a growing number of Westerners doing business in Eastern Europe .
If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture , it is Poland .
The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the Middle Ages .
Mr. Muniak 's company , Balag Ltd. , has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it , but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained .

As they stumble and bumble toward election day two weeks from tomorrow , both Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph Giuliani are in trouble .
But , in the past 10 days , he has taken a series of body blows to his pride and his reputation that could adversely affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become New York 's first black mayor .
But Mr. Giuliani , a celebrated prosecutor , has had difficulty switching from his crime-busting , finger-pointing mode to a political stance that suggests he might know something about running this big , troubled city .
This is the nation 's biggest city and , , its mayor is the nation 's best-known urban politician .
Republicans figured that in Mr. Giuliani , the nation 's best-known prosecutor , they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of Democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star .
`` Dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy , '' says David Garth , veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for Mayor Edward Koch , defeated by Mr. Dinkins in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary .
`` I guess we 'll reluctantly go ahead and do it , vote for Dinkins , '' says Richard Wade , a politically active professor who supported Richard Ravitch , an also-ran in the Democratic primary .
`` We 're picking up steam , '' insists Roger Ailes , Mr. Giuliani 's media consultant , whose last big campaign helped put George Bush in the White House .
But the steam may never reach the engine room .
To help out this week , the White House is dispatching chief of staff John Sununu and three Cabinet members -- HUD 's Jack Kemp , Transportation 's Samuel Skinner and Treasury 's Nicholas Brady , according to Peter Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager .
Historically , New York is almost always in trouble .
This year , the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year .
`` People were n't so happy in the 1930s , '' says Thomas Lessner , another local professor and the biographer of the legendary Fiorello LaGuardia , the city 's fusion mayor who built a coalition Mr. Giuliani hopes to emulate .
The 62-year-old Mr. Dinkins , an ex-Marine , has served as the city clerk and as Manhattan borough president , a job with limited executive responsibilities -LRB- `` I `` I defy you to come up with one major accomplishment of David Dinkins , '' says Mr. Giuliani . -RRB-
His general-election campaign is almost Reagan-like , all muted pictures and comforting words .
Both candidates are negotiating about holding debates , but Mr. Dinkins is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them .
`` He 's got to get Dinkins 's negatives up , '' says Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion .
Why , even 20 % of the Republican vote is going to Dinkins . ''
For the Giuliani forces , it 's a conundrum .
On the other , he seeks to convince voters he 's the new Fiorello LaGuardia -- affable , good-natured and ready to lead New York out of the mess it 's in
Mr. Mason left the campaign after telling reporters Mr. Dinkins is `` a fancy'shvartzer ' with a moustache . ''
Mr. Dinkins concedes nothing in his ability to stumble and bumble .
The Dinkins campaign paid Mr. Carson close to $ 10,000 to get out the vote on primary-election day .
Mr. Carson has been charged with being anti-Semitic .
I 'm anti-white . ''
It began in 1973 , when he was being considered for deputy mayor , and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years .
And now he 's busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in Inner City Broadcasting Co. , headed by his old friend and patron , Percy Sutton , to his son , David Dinkins Jr. , for $ 58,000 .
He says he sold the stock to avoid conflict-of-interest problems in his role as a voting member of the city 's Board of Estimate .
`` It looks like serious tax evasion , '' says Mr. Ailes , the Giuliani media consultant .
He waits to talk about it until after he gets caught . ''
It 's ludicrous for him to suggest it 's the difference between the'breakup ' value of the shares and their market value . ''
`` The crime goes to character , '' says Ron Maiorana , a consultant to the Giuliani campaign .
He evades and ducks .
`` It makes people think , maybe this guy is n't so squeaky clean after all , '' says Mr. Garth , Mayor Koch 's media consultant .
The long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano was reignited by the arrest last week of Rome businessman Flavio Carboni on fraud charges .
Banco Ambrosiano , which was Italy 's largest private-sector bank , collapsed in 1982 with $ 1.3 billion of debts .
The Vatican , which denies any wrongdoing , paid $ 250 million to the Milan bank 's creditors as a `` goodwill gesture '' in 1985 .
Italian papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the Vatican bank from blame in the scandal , or showing that the bank , known as the Istituto per le Opere di Religione , channeled funds to East bloc groups such as Solidarity in Poland .
This business trust company said its board elected Kieran E. Burke , a consultant to Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. , as chief executive officer , a new post , and as president .
Both men were unavailable to comment .
Britain 's Serious Fraud Office said it will investigate the circumstances surrounding alleged phantom contracts at Ferranti International Signal PLC 's International Signal & Control unit .
International Signal & Control , Lancaster , Pa. , a defense-equipment manufacturer , was bought by Ferranti in 1987 for # 420 million -LRB- $ 670.3 million -RRB- .
The Serious Fraud Office , a division of London 's Metropolitan Police responsible for investigating financial crimes , said its work would take in `` allegations of fraud prior to , surrounding and subsequent to the merger . ''
Derek Alun-Jones , Ferranti 's chairman , has said he hoped to pursue legal action against those responsible .
Chicago businessmen Bertram M. Lee and Peter Bynoe signed a new agreement to purchase the Denver Nuggets basketball team , but not as principal owners .
Comsat Video will pay $ 17 million for a 62.5 % interest , with Messrs. Lee and Bynoe putting up $ 8 million for a 37.5 % stake in the team .
Messrs. Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise .
Comsat Video is headed by Robert Wussler , who resigned his No. 2 executive post with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. just two weeks ago to take the Comsat position .
Messrs. Lee and Bynoe will manage the Nuggets ' day-today affairs .
Royal , which makes and distributes business forms , owns an 8 % stake in Realist .
Royal 's suit contends that the Ammann acquisition was `` designed to entrench management and thwart Royal 's offer . ''

Winnebago Industries Inc. , battered by a deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales , reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend in half .
A year earlier , the company had a deficit of $ 1.5 million , or six cents a share .
Indeed , Winnebago said it started `` several promotional programs '' to spur retail sales in the fall and winter .
With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales .
At Winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier .
`` It 's a large-ticket discretionary purchase , '' said Robert Curran , who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch & Co .
Mr. Curran expects industry RV sales for all of 1989 to fall about 5 % from 1988 , when sales of 427,300 units were the highest since 1978 .
But he said the industry has `` a good decade ahead , '' particularly if aging baby boomers fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying RVs .
The company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs , losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle , among other things .
The dividend cut will prove most costly for John K. Hanson , Winnebago 's founder and chairman .
For the year , Winnebago had a loss of $ 4.7 million , or 19 cents a share , following profit of $ 2.7 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier .
Bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again .
And that , they say , will be good for bonds .
Mr. Platt is advising clients that `` the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward . ''
That would be comforting to fixed-income investors , many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease .
But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the Fed 's credit-easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled .
For example , a group of long-term Treasury bonds tracked by Merrill Lynch & Co. produced a total return of 1 % in the first quarter , 12.45 % in the second quarter and % in the third quarter .
Now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins .
At the same time , last week 's consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating .
I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end . ''
Economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the Fed from around 9 % , where it had been since July , to about 8 % in early October on the heels of a weak employment report .
James Kochan , chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch , is touting shorter-term securities , which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall .
Mr. Kochan also likes long-term , investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term Treasurys .
`` If the -LCB- Tennessee Valley Authority -RCB- sale is any guide , there appears to be good demand for top-quality , long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts , '' he said .
Strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion .
But persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week , when the U.S. government will auction more than $ 30 billion of new securities .
Tomorrow , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year notes .
All of this comes ahead of the government 's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt , which takes place sometime in November .
Roger Early , a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Corp. , said that yields on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention .
`` I 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out . ''
When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about percentage point more than the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond .
Some economists believe that yields on all Treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply .
`` The supply is not a constraint to the market , '' said Samuel Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc .
Friday 's Market Activity
Junk bond prices moved higher , however .
Also providing support to Treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks .
Treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as point , or about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to 7.98 % from 7.96 % .
Today , for example , underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co. said they expect to price a $ 150 million , 12-year senior subordinated debenture offering by Imo Industries Inc .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $ 150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected by the end of the month .
`` There are about a dozen more deals coming , '' said Michael McNamara , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc .
Last week , underwriters were forced to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market .
After hours of negotiating that stretched late into Thursday night , underwriters priced the 12-year issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures at par to yield 14.75 % , higher than the 14.5 % that had been expected .
However , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is 15.50 % .
`` The coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to come in , '' said a spokesman for Donaldson .
The spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors .
Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off .
That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house .
The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .
In addition , a handful of paintings from the Dorrance collection remain to be sold at Sotheby 's annual old masters paintings auction in January .
The settlement stems from charges that Better Book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986 .
The conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale .
The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987 .
Morgan Guaranty Trust , Toronto-Dominion Bank and Provident National Bank , an affiliate of PNC Financial Corp. , jointly committed $ 1.2 billion of financing , subject to certain conditions , McCaw said .

Beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and for severe punishment , including the death sentence , for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution .
It quoted Liu Changyi , deputy director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau , as saying that there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985 , when there were about 100 cases .
The Communists nearly succeeded in eliminating prostitution after taking over in 1949 , but the practice has returned in recent years with the country 's increased exposure to the outside world .

Trade and Supply Minister Gerhard Briksa said in a letter published in the youth daily Junge Welt that the rise in alcohol consumption in East Germany had been halted ; but to reduce it further , he said , production and supply of other beverages , including fruit juices , should be stepped up .
Hong Kong has built a detention center for illegal immigrants from China because China has refused for the past two weeks to accept them back .
The dispute started when China , angry that Hong Kong had allowed dissident swimmer Yang Yang to flee to the U.S. , halted the usual daily transfer of illegal immigrants caught in this British colony , which reverts to Beijing 's control in 1997 .
A group of senior Conservative legislators , complaining the House of Commons was like a sauna , demanded that the experiment be stopped unless the intensity of the lights is reduced .

Instead , many small and medium-sized banks , and some larger ones , are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan , Japanese banking officials said .
The officials said that most Japanese banks prefer the losses they 'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending .
`` They ca n't take the hit '' to their earnings , he said .

Ekco Group Inc. , Nashua , N.H. , expects to report that net income in the third quarter , ended Oct. 1 , fell 50 % to 60 % from $ 2.1 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier .
Softer-than-expected orders in early September also played a role , he said in an interview .
That would require fourth-quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share , assuming that Mr. Stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate .
Third-quarter revenue is expected to be $ 40 million to $ 45 million , up from $ 38.2 million a year earlier , according to Neil Gordon , treasurer .

But the unit 's third segment , wildlife traps , is suffering from a `` depressed market , '' and Ekco is seeking to sell that segment , he said .
Prior to acquiring the housewares business , the company was known as Centronics Corp. ; Centronics had been a maker of computer printers , but Mr. Stein and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market . -RRB-
By moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently , he said .
Ekco 's housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets , as well as bakeware , at factories in the U.S. and Canada .
The strike ended Oct .
He indicated that Ekco may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $ 75 million to $ 100 million , partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger , and fewer , suppliers .
The imposition of austerity measures , starting last October , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter .
And Beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash .
Last year 's retrenchment dried up the working capital of Chinese factories .
The June killings magnified the problems .
At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in August and September , manager Donald Lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months .
He predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million .
But in general , all foreign-trading companies are feeling the pinch .
On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . ''
The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86 , when Beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange .
In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback .
Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half .
The picture for China 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze .
The threat to China 's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings .
The trend has prompted Beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports .
The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses .
For example , Nissho Iwai Corp. , one of the biggest Japanese trading houses , now buys almost twice as many goods from China as it sells to that country .
But the strategy is n't helping much this time .
He expects the company 's trading business to drop as much as 40 % this year .
Many foreign trading offices in Hong Kong were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from Chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties .
But when foreign traders tried to do business , they discovered that the eagerness of Chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen .
Business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say .
Sitco had customarily tapped the Japanese bond market for funds , but it ca n't do that any longer .
`` It has difficulties paying its foreign debts , '' says a Hong Kong executive who is familiar with Sitco 's business .
Foreign traders also say many of China 's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit .
`` There are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , '' he says .
And foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because China is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years .
These have been among the country 's leading imports , particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly .
To stem speculation , Beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year .
The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market .
Mr. Kamm , the China trade expert , estimates that as much as 50 % of Guangdong 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials .
AN UNRESOLVED two-year-old dispute stemming from an Alaskan oil spill has helped spur a drive for tougher federal laws to protect victims of such accidents .
On July 2 , 1987 , the tanker S.S. Glacier Bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the Cook Inlet .
Defendants include British Petroleum America ; Trinidad Corp. , the shipper ; and the pipeline liability fund .
The fund is required to pay claims up to an additional $ 86 million .
But the Glacier Bay case , the fund 's first test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined .
It claims the Coast Guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages .
The Oil Pollution Act , scheduled to come up for a vote in Congress this fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90 days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for Rep. George Miller -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , a sponsor of the bill .

Los Angeles Creates A Courthouse for Kids
The building , which will handle child abuse , custody and foster care cases , will be `` less formal , less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses , '' says Edmund Edelman , chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors .
There will be recreation and movie rooms .
Study halls , complete with reference materials , will be available .
The building 's 25 courtrooms will be smaller , says Charlene Saunders , a court administrator .
Cases in Los Angeles County involving dependent children are usually heard in the Criminal Courts Building .

Law Firm Management Can Be Quite Rewarding
That 's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by Altman & Weil Inc. , an Ardmore , Pa. , law firm consultant .
Managing partners who responded to the survey typically spend over half their time supervising their firms ' day-to-day operations and just a little more than a third of their time practicing law .
Chairman Jamie Whitten -LRB- D. , Miss . -RRB- of the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $ 2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo .
The funds would be attached to a stop-gap spending bill required to keep most of the government operating past Wednesday .
The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the Small Business Administration .
Dubbed the `` Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance , '' the measure is vintage Whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments .
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of Pinnacle debt because of `` accelerating deficiency in liquidity , '' which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments .

Moody 's said it also lowered the ratings of $ 70 million of Pinnacle 's MeraBank thrift unit long-term deposits to B-3 from B-2 , and on its subordinated debt to Ca from Caa .
Securities of MeraBank were placed under review last May , and will remain under review for downgrade , the agency said .

Lisa Zeidner 's third novel , `` Limited Partnerships '' -LRB- North Point Press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it .
Malcolm , a former film-maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly-by-night real estate developer .
After all , she reasons , `` there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who would kill for her job . ''

Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives .
While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom .
The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a `` safe '' middle-class haven : Nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere .
In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters .

`` Rascal Money '' -LRB- Contemporary Books , 412 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber , tells the story of an innovative , well-run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW , a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world .
But , as he and his skilled team soon discover , they 're up against two factors they had n't counted on : first , a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover ; second , that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger , shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal .

Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to Japan , not everyone here is ready to give up .
With only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government .
Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton , Ore. , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans .
Two other firms , Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy , Mich. , and Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays .
Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television , or HDTV , which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade .
But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels .
`` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says .
`` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says Zvi Yaniv , the president of Ovonic Imaging .
The Bush administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be , is n't doing much for now .
The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending .
`` Unless it gets more help , the U.S. industry wo n't have a chance , '' says Peter Friedman , Photonics 's executive vice president .
But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording .
The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image .
Mr. Brody left the company to find other backers .
`` Most American investors have just given up , '' Mr. Brody says .
Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds .
So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds .
The Navy is ordering displays for its Aegis cruisers and the Army wants smaller versions for its Abrams battle tanks .
`` It is n't just yuppie television , '' argues Jack Clifford , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation .
Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research consortia , the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds .
They also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the Pentagon and Commerce department 's concern over their future .
And they want the U.S. to help them sell overseas .

A year earlier , it had a loss of $ 199,203 or nine cents a share , on revenue of $ 7.6 million .
At least , that 's a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of above-average performers .
Remember them ?
That sort of workhorse performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years .
Those are unwelcome trends in a year that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 23 % so far , even with the 190.58-point plunge on Oct. 13 ; broader market measures are in the same neighborhood .
That 's the path of reasoning leading to growth stocks .
Growth stocks may be as big as Philip Morris or medium-sized such as Circuit City Stores , but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least 15 % to 20 % a year , money managers say .
Growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility , which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to discern where the economy is heading .
And they will again , say money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme .
He also thinks foreign investors , who are showing signs of more discriminate investing , will join the pursuit and pump up prices .
Mr. Smith recommends Cypress Semiconductor that is currently showing a robust 63 % earnings growth rate .
Mr. Sloan praises the company as recession resistant and notes that it has an annual earnings growth rate of 32 % a year over the past five years .
Others preach the gospel of buying only blue-chip growth stocks .
He recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as Philip Morris , PepsiCo , CPC International , Reebok International , and Limited Inc .
Some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle .
James Wright , chief investment officer for Banc One Asset Management , says , `` We 've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks . ''
He is putting money in Dress Barn , Circuit City Stores , Bruno 's , and Rubbermaid .
He cites IBM , which reported a 30 % earnings decline in the third quarter , and which last week announced a $ 1 billion buy-back of its shares .
`` When they are buying back stock at 10 times earnings , they are suggesting that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below '' returns on the stock .
But not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals .
Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Einhorn , for one , subscribes to that scenario .

Airline Aviation , which has annual revenue of $ 5 million to $ 6 million , has great growth potential because of the large number of U.S. pilots nearing retirement age , Comair said .
The collapse of a $ 6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has handed Wall Street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal .
In the six trading days since the UAL labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing , culminating Friday with the withdrawal of its partner British Airways PLC , UAL stock has plummeted by 41 % to 168 from 285 .
In the meantime , the question faced by investors is : What is UAL stock worth ?
That 's based on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10 times UAL earnings , which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ 16 a share this year .
That 's because airline earnings , like those of auto makers , have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy .
So anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover , and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event .
At that level , and given the uncertainty , he believes UAL stock should trade closer to
By that logic , the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months , even though the eventual price might be higher .
The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ 200 million , and to commit $ 200 million from their retirement funds .
However , investment bankers say that banks are n't likely to lend the almost $ 5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17 % in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Corp. in July .
That way , they figure , someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work , because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs .
That leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ 1 billion -- far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone .
Investors such as Marvin Davis of Los Angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they , not the pilots , must have control .
The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions , using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking .
The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied .
Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 .
Using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios , First Boston estimated UAL 's value at $ 248 to $ 287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections ; $ 237 to $ 275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA ; $ 98 to $ 121 under an adverse labor settlement , and $ 229 to $ 270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike .
Unfortunately , all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month .
Some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots .
I do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving . ''
In the meantime , the arbs are bleeding .
Frank Gallagher , an analyst with Phoenix Capital Corp. in New York , estimates that the arbs paid an average of about $ 280 a share for their UAL positions .

Industry executives said Interpublic approached Saatchi in August about buying its Campbell-Mithun-Esty unit , but was turned down by Chairman Maurice Saatchi .
Interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer , Philip Geier Jr. , made the pitches in visits to Mr. Saatchi in London , the executives said .
But the spokesman confirmed that Saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its Campbell-Mithun and Rowland units .
Interpublic declined comment .
Takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , has said it 's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring .
In the midst of the current turmoil , Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses .
It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi .
But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses .
Campbell-Mithun-Esty , for example , has had big problems at its New York office , but offers strong offices in other areas of the country , including Minneapolis and Chicago .
While there would be some client conflicts , they would n't be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi 's other agencies . -RRB-
Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms .
Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been attempting to buy itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm .
Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . ''
Prudential 's Final Four

A spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm , based in Newark , N.J. , said it hopes to make a decision within three to four months .
The Jamaica Tourist Board , in the wake of Young & Rubicam 's indictment on charges that it bribed Jamaican officials to win the account in 1981 , released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident .

Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that receive its funding , the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era .
John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore , animal-rights activists do $ 3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis , Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and Dutch-elm-disease researcher Gary Strobel 's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for `` violating '' EPA rules .
Mr. Dingell , by the way , has decreed another NIH investigation of the Baltimore paper , adding to several previous investigations .
Fortunately , there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out .
NASA defended itself vigorously and successfully against a Rifkin suit to block the Galileo launch .
In a media-linked world , scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work , but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work .

Federal child care -LRB- quack -RRB- .
The disabled-workers bill -LRB- quack , quack -RRB- .
It comes up with a toned-down version of a Democratic proposal .
Consider , for instance , the very fat fowl known as federalized child care .
It would create 38,000 local day-care commissions , answerable to the Department of Health and Human Services .
The initial costs are said to be in the $ 2 billion a year range , but that 's only the beginning .
The administration claims that its Clean Air bill will cost businesses between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion annually , but economist Michael Evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ 60 billion a year range .
For example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants .
The money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology .
Proponents of the nationwide standards say the cost for car buyers would be about $ 500 per car .
Nobody knows how many billions of dollars the Americans With Disabilities Act will cost , because nobody knows what the bill entails .
Judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts .
Private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge bill .
All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people , states and local governments .
In fact , during last year 's campaign , the entire nation constantly heard Mr. Bush tout his accomplishments as head of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief .
But with the impending passage of these new programs , Mr. Bush will surely be sending many people hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut back .
Then it turned up , and by one estimate the number will be up to about 109,000 regulators by next year .
We would have thought by now , though , that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation is n't the only way to slow down an economy .
What is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well-intentioned public programs often backfire .
The Bush administration ought to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non-duck ducks .
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week .

At the same time , he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports , given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows .
However , Mr. Dillow said he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports .
Mr. Briscoe , who also forecasts a # 1.3 billion current account gap , warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling , the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions .
Meanwhile , overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded .
U.K. base rates are at their highest level in eight years .
The figures show that spending rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago .
Mr. Dillow said the data show the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises .
Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . ''
And , they warn , any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow .

Trucking , shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases , scheduled for this fall or early next year , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport .
That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad .
Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year .
`` This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said Bernard LaLonde , a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus .
Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill .
But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates .
`` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years .
Robert Delaney , a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said `` We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions .
You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . ''
`` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said Gerard McCullough , lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The carriers were competing fiercely for market share .
An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . ''
Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros .
Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month .
Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan .
Some bulk shipping rates have increased `` 3 % to 4 % in the past few months , '' said Salomon 's Mr. Lloyd .
Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels .

Bob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination .
Unable to persuade the manager to change his decision , he went to a `` company court '' for a hearing .
After the three members of the court introduced themselves , the chairman of the panel said : `` Go ahead and tell us what happened .
No lawyers or tape recorders were present .
Over a cup of coffee , Mr. Stone told his story .
When he was through , the court members asked many questions , then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses .
Bob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real .
The court is called the Management Appeals Committee , or just `` MAC , '' and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year .
These firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what I call corporate due process .
In the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are likely to adopt it .
It reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees , with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations .
It increases employee commitment to the company , with all that means for efficiency and quality control .
Here are four key steps :
It must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates , else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases .
At TWA , the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year , only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists .
In a typical year , up to 20 % of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment .
2 . Formally or informally , train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach .
Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately .
In the 15 companies I studied , reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 % .
A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support .
International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach .
It wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it .
On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists .
Naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it .
Federal Express goes further in this respect than any company I know of with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale , chief executive and chief operating officer , respectively , sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases .

The U.S. is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives , government officials said .
The existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday .
According to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines .
No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him .
The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules .
It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
The statement added , `` Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government .
Sen. Boren said , `` It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future .
Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine , the panel 's vice chairman , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . ''
But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress .
The guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations .
One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life .
Although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt , some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama .
The issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts .
Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation .
The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action .
Nevertheless , the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens. Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president .
The new argument over the notification guideline , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed .

The government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross national product this week in a report that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation .
But inflation , as measured by the GNP deflator in Thursday 's report , is expected to rise only 3.5 % , down from 4.6 % in the second quarter .
`` If that gets people excited , it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he added .
Most are expected to fall below previous-month levels .
In addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter .
`` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says Michael K. Evans , president of Evans Economics Inc. , Washington .
On the other hand , Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP . ''
Demand , he believes , is being met from overhang rather than new production .
Edward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas .
He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures .

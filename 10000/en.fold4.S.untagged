For bankers and regulators , Arizona is looking more like Texas every day .
On Friday , Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp said it expects a net loss of $ 16 million for the third quarter of 1989 because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit .
First Interstate said the unit , bludgeoned by Arizona 's worsening real-estate woes , will have a $ 174 million loss for the quarter .
First Interstate took a huge $ 350 million provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank .
It charged off an estimated $ 200 million of Arizona loans , leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ 255 million , about 61 % of its $ 416 million of troubled loans and repossessed real estate .
First Interstate made the move under pressure from regulators .
The action capped a spurt of grim Arizona banking news for the third quarter , and emphatically signaled that Arizona is challenging Texas 's long reign as banking 's busiest graveyard .
Earlier last week , Valley National Corp. , the state 's largest locally owned banking company , reported a $ 72.2 million loss and suspended its dividend .
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. , which has been wrangling with regulators for months over what to do about Pinnacle 's moribund Merabank thrift unit , suspended its dividend and reported a 91 % plunge in third-quarter net income .
Security Pacific Corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ 109 million , mainly because of sour Arizona real-estate loans .
New York-based Chase Manhattan Corp. took an $ 85 million Arizona-related charge .
Furthermore , the regulatory maneuvering behind First Interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future Arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it .
Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had been combing through First Interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month ; they first recommended that First Interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $ 350 million third-quarter hit .
When First Interstate balked , arguing that the figure was too high , regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ 350 million .
`` At that point , -LCB- First Interstate -RCB- decided it was the better part of valor not to negotiate further , '' said one industry official close to the talks .
Thomas P. Marrie , chief financial officer , would n't comment about the details of the negotiations .
He said the provision `` was n't forced upon us , but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number . ''
The tough regulatory stance portends large future losses , especially at the state 's thrifts .
At least six of Arizona 's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent ; they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses .
For example , Western Savings & Loan Association , which is now in conservatorship , had tangible capital-assets minus liabilities -- of a negative $ 357.4 million at June 30 .
It had a $ 258.9 million loss in the second quarter .
Yet it still held $ 916.3 million of repossessed real estate , for which it maintains no reserves whatsoever .
It also had $ 479.7 million of past-due loans ; its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available , though it is believed to be small .
The rapid deterioration of the Arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout , officially estimated at about $ 166 billion .
Together , the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent Arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $ 1.5 billion , foreclosed property of $ 1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $ 1.63 billion .
They have no reserves against the real estate , and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up .
The thrifts had a combined loss of $ 487.8 million in the second quarter .
Other lenders have been recovering only 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar on foreclosed Arizona property , if they can sell it at all .
All this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in Arizona 's boom-and-bust history , compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles : greed , fraud and plain bad banking .
In the late 1970s and early 1980s , lenders and developers poured money into office buildings , condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land , confident that Arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of 4 % to 6 % for years to come .
Now , annual population growth is running at about 2 % a year , some desert tracts bought three years ago for $ 90,000 an acre are being sold at $ 25,000 an acre and Phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office space .
`` It 's horrible to say , but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in Phoenix -- it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings , '' said C.W. Jackson , a prominent Arizona businessman with interests in real estate , banking and many other businesses .
Many Arizona real-estate experts think the worst may be yet to come .
Ralph Shattuck , publisher of Foreclosure Update newsletter , said foreclosures have climbed to about 1,482 a month just in Maricopa County , where Phoenix is located .
That 's up from about 687 a month in 1985 , and it 's accelerating : So far this month , foreclosures are averaging about 85 a day .
`` It 's frightening , '' Mr. Shattuck said .
Moreover , Mr. Shattuck and others said residential real estate , which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn , is beginning to comprise more and more of the foreclosures .
And the generally frail condition of Arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide .
`` It 's reasonable to say there is not a solvent S&L in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low , '' said Mr. Jackson .
`` We 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end .
The only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is : ` Pay me in 60 days . ' ''
First Interstate had a $ 214.4 million loss in 1988 's third quarter , mainly from writedowns and reserves connected with its Texas operations .
For the six months ended June 30 , it reported net income of $ 234.3 million , or $ 4.83 a share , including $ 46 million from tax credits and accounting changes .
The bank 's Arizona unit holds about $ 6 billion of First Interstate 's $ 50 billion of assets .
Mr. Marrie said the bank expects Arizona real-estate prices , which plummeted 40 % over the last year , to fall another 20 % before stabilizing .
Some in Arizona think that may be optimistic .
First Interstate said its operations outside of Arizona `` achieved results as expected for the quarter , '' but did n't specify the results .
First Interstate stock closed at $ 57.625 , down 25 cents , in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange .
Since its unsuccessful bid for BankAmerica Corp. in 1986 , the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance , but many industry officials believe it may be ripe for a takeover bid , especially with interstate banking set to begin in California in 1991 .
Mr. Marrie said the problems in Arizona have only `` increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective . ''
Separately , Standard & Poor 's Corp. lowered its ratings on Valley National Corp. 's senior debt to double-B from double-B-plus , affecting about $ 300 million of long-term debt .
S&P also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company 's principal unit , Valley National Bank of Arizona .
The ratings service said the downgrades reflect the continued slide in the company 's financial condition .
A spokesman for Phoenix , Ariz.-based Valley National , said the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in Arizona real estate .
Commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds , he said , and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days .
Immunex Corp. said its scientists isolated a molecule which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune-system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma .
The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor .
IL-4 is a hormone which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response .
The IL-4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone 's message to rally the body 's defense .
But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection , doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction .
A soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression , the company said .
The IL-4 receptor is one of five such receptors to be developed and tested by Receptech Corp. , a spinoff of Immunex , through a proposed $ 30 million initial public offering .
Immunex will contract with the spinoff to provide the research , development and initial testing of the new agents .
Immunex will have the option to buy back Receptech shares after five years .

Conner Peripherals Inc. , which has a near-monopoly on a key part used in many portable computers , is on target to surpass Compaq Computer Corp. as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in U.S. business history .
Conner dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers .
It said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared 72 % to $ 11.8 million , or 28 cents a share , from $ 6.8 million , or 19 cents a share , in the year-ago period .
Its revenue totaled $ 184.4 million , an increase of 172 % from $ 67.8 million a year ago .
For the nine months , the San Jose , Calif.-based company said net income jumped 84 % to $ 26.9 million , or 69 cents a share , from $ 14.6 million , or 43 cents a share .
Revenue nearly tripled to $ 479 million , from $ 160 million .
Analysts expect Conner 's earnings to reach roughly $ 40 million , or $ 1 to $ 1.05 a share , on sales of $ 650 million , for 1989 , the company 's third full year in business .
That 's a faster growth rate than reported by Compaq , which did n't post similar results until its fourth year , in 1986 .
But Compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up .
Conner 's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers , the computer industry 's fastest-growing segment .
Since its inception , Conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines .
Today , Conner controls an estimated 90 % of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers .
The company supplies drives to Compaq and Zenith Data Systems , the top two U.S. manufacturers of laptops , and to Toshiba Corp. , NEC Corp. and Sharp Corp. , the leading Japanese laptop makers .
`` They 've had this field to themselves for over a year now , and they 've been greatly rewarded , '' said Bob Katsive , an analyst at Inc. , a market researcher in Los Altos , Calif .
In the coming months , however , this is likely to change .
Next month , Seagate Technology , which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers , plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers .
And the Japanese are likely to keep close on Conner 's heels .
`` They are going to catch up , '' said David Claridge , an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist .
Both Toshiba and NEC already produce hard-disk drives , and Sony also is studying the field , Mr. Claridge said .
But Conner is n't standing still .
Yesterday , the company introduced four products , three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called notebooks .
Each of the three drives uses a mere 1.5 watts of power and one weighs just 5.5 ounces .
`` Most of our competitors are announcing products based on our -LRB- older -RRB- products , '' said Finis Conner , chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name .
`` We continue to develop products faster than anyone else can . ''
These new products could account for as much as 35 % of the company 's business in 1990 , Mr. Conner estimated .
`` We 're not afraid of obsoleting some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition , '' he said .
Conner already is shipping its new drives .
Last week , for instance , Compaq introduced its first notebook computer to rave reviews .
Conner is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine , which weighs only six pounds and fits in a briefcase .
From its inception , Conner has targeted the market for battery-operated machines , building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as Seagate .
The availability of these drives , in turn , boosted demand for laptop computers , whose usefulness had been limited because of lack of storage .
Conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to Compaq , which as of July owned 40 % of Conner 's stock .
Sales to Compaq represented 26 % of Conner 's business in its third quarter , compared with 42 % in the year-ago period .
Move over , pornographic phone services : A legal service with a `` 900 '' number has been launched in California .
A Newport Beach law firm started the pay-as-you-go legal service , called Telelawyer , using MCI Communication Corp. 's toll-tele-phone service .
Cane & Associates touts its $ 2-a-minute service as the `` cheapest legal hour you 'll ever find . ''
Though the service is available only in California , Telelawyer founder Michael Cane says he plans to franchise it in other states .
He says his aim is to reach people who are bedridden , have no access to transportation , ca n't find a lawyer to take their case or simply ca n't afford lawyers ' consultation fees .
Mr. Cane stresses that he is n't using the telephone to lure clients to his doorstep .
`` We will only deal with clients on the phone , '' he says .
We have no in-office business . ''
Telelawyer is apparently the only telephone service that offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit .
Local bar associations in some states have numbers that provide free tape-recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law .
There also are `` 800 '' hotlines which refer people to lawyers , usually personal-injury specialists , for in-office consultation .
When a caller reaches Telelawyer by dialing 900-TELELAW , a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys .
In an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue , Cane lawyers review documents and perform research , if necessary , with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers .
There is no charge for research -- only for time on the phone .
If the matter requires further legal work or litigation , Mr. Cane says , his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm .
But he says Cane & Associates does n't receive referral fees .
So far , says Mr. Cane , most calls have involved landlord-tenant problems , tax problems , divorce , and probate questions .
The firm is getting about 50 calls a day , and the average call lasts about 15 minutes .
Out of the $ 2 charge , the law firm pockets about $ 1.55 .
JURY CONVICTS congressman in connection with Wedtech Corp. scandal .
A federal court jury in New York found U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- and his wife , Jane Lee Garcia , guilty of extorting $ 76,000 from Wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman .
The jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $ 20,000 , interest-free loan from a Wedtech officer .
The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in obtaining the payments , some of which were disguised as fees for consulting services from Mrs. Garcia .
Wedtech , which became embroiled in political-corruption cases that eventually led to its demise , formerly was a minority-owned South Bronx , N.Y. , defense contractor .
Edward J.M. Little , one of the assistant U.S. attorneys who prosecuted the case , said the Garcia trial `` is the last of the Wedtech prosecutions . ''
Mr. Little said more than 20 people have been convicted in the Wedtech cases , including former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- .
Lawyers for the Garcias said they plan to appeal .
Mr. Garcia , who represents New York 's 18th congressional district , which includes the Bronx , said he has n't decided whether he will resign .
`` In the next few weeks , I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of preserving the interests of my constituents , '' said Mr. Garcia , 56 years old .
Mrs. Garcia , 49 , formerly was a member of Mr. Garcia 's congressional staff .
The Garcias were cleared of four other felony counts , involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities .
U.S. Judge Leonard B. Sand set the Garcias ' sentencing for Jan. 5 .
FIVE SHEA & GOULD PARTNERS are leaving to form a new firm .
The new firm , Hutton Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti , will be based in New York .
The five partners who resigned from Shea & Gould late last week are Tom Hutton , Sam Ingram , Dean Yuzek , Daniel Carroll and Ernest Bertolotti .
They will be joined by Larry Gainen , who resigned from the firm of LePatner , Gainen & Block .
Howard Rubenstein , a New York publicist who represents Shea & Gould , said , `` Shea & Gould understands they 're leaving because they wanted a different environment -- a smaller firm they would be principals of . ''
Mr. Rubenstein said the five , who were n't on Shea & Gould 's management committee , `` are leaving on good terms . ''
He said Shea & Gould held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to running their own firm .
Hutton Ingram will have a general corporate , securities , real-estate and litigation practice , and a substantial practice serving the professional-design community .
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS against lawyers open to public in Illinois .
While investigations into lawyer misconduct will remain secret , the public will be notified once a formal complaint is filed against an attorney .
The actual disciplinary hearings will be public .
In addition , Illinois attorneys will lose the right to sue clients who file malicious complaints against them .
Non-lawyers will be added to the inquiry panels that look into allegations of misconduct .
Illinois joins 36 other states that allow public participation in attorney-disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that open disciplinary hearings to the public , according to the American Bar Association .
One vocal critic of the changes , Chicago lawyer Warren Lupel , says non-lawyers should n't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely to appreciate the nuances of attorney-client relationships .
In addition , he says , publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation .
Nevertheless , Mr. Lupel anticipates no legal action to reverse the Illinois Supreme Court 's decision to institute the changes .
`` There 's no constitutional right involved in the rule change , '' he says .
`` You do n't have a right to practice .
You only have a privilege to practice . ''
DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed to pay a $ 50,000 fine to Delaware , the 26th state to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm 's guilty plea to federal insider-trading charges .
Drexel does n't have a Delaware office , but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon .
The firm has said it expects to pay $ 11.5 million overall to settle with states .
Drexel pleaded guilty in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud ; it also made a $ 650 million civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Philip Morris Cos. , whose Benson & Hedges cigarette brand has been losing market share , has asked at least one other agency to try its hand at creative work for the big account , which has been at Wells Rich Greene Inc. since 1966 .
Executives close to Philip Morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc. , a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , and possibly others to work on creative ideas for the account .
Several executives said another potential contender is WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather agency , which works on some other Philip Morris products .
Both Philip Morris and Backer Spielvogel declined to comment .
A spokeswoman for Ogilvy & Mather said the agency does n't comment on `` idle speculation . ''
Also mentioned as a contender was TBWA Advertising , but the company denied it was participating .
The loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to Wells Rich .
Benson & Hedges has been one of its most high-visibility campaigns , as well as one of its largest clients .
The account billed almost $ 60 million last year , according to Leading National Advertisers .
But Philip Morris has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year , industry executives said , and it now bills about $ 30 million to $ 40 million .
Industry executives said Philip Morris had asked the other agencies to create campaigns in a bid to stop the brand 's slipping market share .
According to John Maxwell , an analyst at Wheat First Securities , Richmond , Va. , Benson & Hedges has slipped from 4.7 % of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1 % after the second quarter of this year .
The brand is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business , Mr. Maxwell said .
The slip has come despite high-profile ads created by Wells Rich , including one picturing a young man clad only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch .
That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was and what he was doing .
Wells Rich first popularized the Benson & Hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying , among other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette .
The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal -- a trait that some analysts believe is partly responsible for its staid performance .
Philip Morris , trying to revive the Benson & Hedges franchise , put the account up for review in 1986 .
Wells Rich Greene , however , in an effort directed by Mary Wells Lawrence , emerged the victor of the review and retained the business .
Kenneth Olshan , Wells Rich 's chairman , did n't return phone calls seeking comment .
While Wells Rich recently picked up Hertz Corp. 's $ 25 million to $ 30 million account , it has lost a number of big accounts this year , including the $ 20 million to $ 25 million Cadbury-Schweppes Canada Dry and Sunkist accounts , the $ 18 million Procter & Gamble Co . Sure deodorant account and the $ 10 million Lauren business .
Its victories include more than $ 30 million in Sheraton Corp. business and an assignment from Dun & Bradstreet worth $ 5 million to $ 10 million .
This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged by last week 's earthquake .
Estimates of damage in the six-county San Francisco Bay area neared $ 5 billion , excluding the cost of repairing the region 's transportation system .
The Bay Bridge , the main artery into San Francisco from the east , will be closed for at least several weeks .
Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale .
The bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day .
Also , most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south , the 101 freeway , have been closed for repairs .
The Bay Area Rapid Transit system , which runs subway trains beneath the bay , is braced for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000 .
BART has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught .
Most unusual will be water-borne commuters from the East Bay towns of Oakland and Berkeley .
For the first time in 32 years , ferry service has been restored between the East Bay and San Francisco .
The Red and White Fleet , which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County , and tourist tours of the bay , is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of $ 10 round-trip .
That tariff is too stiff for some Financial District wage earners .
`` I 'll stay with BART , '' said one secretary , swallowing her fears about using the transbay tube .
Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped with an extra load of commuters , including East Bay residents making a long detour .
`` We 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , '' said one official .
About 23,000 people typically travel over the Golden Gate Bridge during commute hours .
About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24-hour period .
Meetings canceled by Apple Computer Inc. 's European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants .
It also raised hackles of the city 's tourism boosters .
`` Other cities are calling -LCB- groups booked here for tours and conferences -RCB- and -- not to be crass -- stealing our booking list , '' said Scott Shafer , a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos .
City officials stuck by their estimate of $ 2 billion in damage to the quake-shocked city .
The other five Bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $ 2.8 billion .
All estimates exclude highway repair , which could exceed $ 1 billion .
Among the expensive unknowns are stretches of elevated freeway in San Francisco that were closed because of quake-inflicted damage .
The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known as the Embarcadero Freeway .
Until it was closed Tuesday , it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the Financial District .
Engineers say it will take at least eight months to repair the Embarcadero structure .
As part of the quake recovery effort , the city Building Department has surveyed about 3,000 buildings , including all of the Financial District 's high-rises .
The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high-rises is that `` we were incredibly lucky , '' said Lawrence Kornfield , San Francisco 's chief building inspector .
While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage , little of that involved major structural damage .
City building codes require construction that can resist temblors .
In England , Martin Leach , a spokesman for Lloyd 's of London , said the insurance market has n't yet been able to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster .
`` The extent of the claims wo n't be known for some time , '' Mr. Leach said .
On Friday , during a visit to California to survey quake damage , President Bush promised to `` meet the federal government 's obligation '' to assist relief efforts .
California officials plan to ask Congress for $ 3 billion or more of federal aid , in the form of grants and low-interest loans .
The state has a $ 1 billion reserve , and is expected to add $ 1 billion to that fund in the next year .
Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax to raise money for earthquake relief .
However , state initiatives restrict the ability of the legislature to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum .

Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd. posted a loss for fiscal 1989 of 980.2 million Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 762.4 million -RRB- , the largest in Australian corporate history .
That loss compared with a year-earlier profit of A$ 273.5 million .
In preliminary , unaudited results reported Friday , Bond Corp. also posted an operating loss of A$ 814.1 million for the year ended June 30 , compared with operating profit of A$ 354.7 million a year earlier .
Operating revenue rose 69 % to A$ 8.48 billion from A$ 5.01 billion .
But the net interest bill jumped 85 % to A$ 686.7 million from A$ 371.1 million .
Bond Corp. has interests in brewing , media and communications , natural resources and property .
Much of Bond Corp. 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of Bond Corp. 's assets and those of its units .
The results included a A$ 453.4 million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of A$ 149.5 million on the sale of a stake of about 20 % in Lonrho PLC .
However , Bond Corp. said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later .
Earnings before interest and tax from brewing dived 50 % to A$ 123.8 million from A$ 247.3 million .
The company said the general financial performance of its U.S. brewing operations , G. Heileman Brewing Co. , was `` disappointing , and this has been reflected in the results . ''
Bond Corp. 's shares closed Friday before news of the results at 28 Australian cents a share , up one Australian cent .
The staggering losses cap a tumultuous year for Alan Bond and his flagship , Bond Corp .
Only a year ago , the chairman of Bond Corp. , who controls about 58 % of the company , appeared to be building a war chest to attack some big companies .
Now Bond Corp. has agreed to sell at least half its Australian brewing assets .
It has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block .
But in a TV interview Sunday Mr. Bond said , `` We 've taken a big loss .
We 've taken it on the chin .
But we 're out there and we 're going to stay in business .
Bond Corp. signaled it will focus on building its domestic and international media and communications businesses .
It said it will look at opportunities in brewing , property and energy resources to the extent consistent with the dominant objective of manageable debt-to-assets ratios .
The result `` will ultimately be a very different group in size and structure , '' Bond Corp. directors said in a statement .
Some analysts contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater , and Bond Corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is `` uncertainty '' regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm .
Bond Corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 Australian cents a share , vs. positive asset backing of A$ 1.92 a share a year ago .
Still , the directors said , `` Having fully considered all aspects of the company 's state of affairs and future cash flows , the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent . ''
Indeed , in a note to the results , directors said if the `` true worth '' of some of the group 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values , the negative net asset backing a share would turn into `` a substantial positive '' one .
The Bakersfield Supermarket went out of business last May .
The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs .
Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area , the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan .
The business closed when the owner was murdered by robbers .
The owner was Israel Ortiz , a 29-year-old entrepreneur and father of two .
In his first year of operating the store he bought for $ 220,000 , Mr. Ortiz was robbed at least twice at gunpoint .
The first time he was shot in the hand as he chased the robbers outside .
The second time he identified two robbers , who were arrested and charged .
Two weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- Mr. Ortiz was shot three times in the back , during what police classified as a third robbery attempt .
That was his reward for working until 11 p.m. seven days a week to cover his $ 3,000 a month rent .
For providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service .
For creating a focus for neighborhood life .
Israel Ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year .
The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2 % of all retail-sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door-to-door salespeople .
Only a few other occupations have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers .
Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem .
Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture .
While by no means the highest crime community in the country , New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small-business development .
A survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by Interface , a policy research organization .
It gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses .
The survey found that over a three-year period 22 % of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job .
Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed .
Crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19 % said they were considering moving .
More than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises .
In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized each year .
Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average .
Crime is clearly more deadly to small-scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses .
Two decades ago , the Small Business Administration reported Yale Prof. Albert Reiss 's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national IRS records .
He found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones .
The New York study 's companies averaged 27 employees ; their annual crime losses averaged about $ 15,000 , with an additional $ 8,385 annual cost in security -- enough money to hire at least one more worker .
The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business .
Whatever the monetary crime losses , they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury .
After repeated gun robberies , some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives .
One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises .
These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls `` crime causing poverty . ''
Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , contributing to the poverty of local residents .
Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses .
This may help explain why small businesses create 65 % of all jobs nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York .
Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime .
The New York study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 per worker , compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees .
The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments .
Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places .
Since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % .
Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants .
In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally relies on the public police force for protection .
This creates several problems .
One is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses .
The number one proposal for reducing crime in the New York survey was to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents .
Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded by the merchants themselves .
A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses .
Only half the New York small businesses surveyed , for their part , are satisfied with the police response they receive .
Some cities , including New York , have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses .
But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .
Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas .
For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits .
Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density .
With National Institute of Justice support , the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy , comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols .
Small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect .
While no guarantee , an increased police presence might even deter further attacks .
It might even have saved the life , and business , of Israel Ortiz .

ENFIELD Corp. said in Toronto that it hopes to raise 56 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 47.7 million -RRB- through a rights offering to shareholders .
Under the offer , shareholders can purchase one Enfield share at C$ 6.27 for each five shares held .
In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday , Enfield closed at C$ 6.75 , down 37.5 cents .
The holding company said the rights offering should reduce its C$ 171 million debt to `` more manageable levels '' before Dec. 31 and allow it to finance future investments with equity capital .
At last report , Enfield had about 44.5 million shares outstanding .
Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick , in a CNN `` Capital Gang '' discussion Oct. 7 of House action on federal catastrophic-illness insurance :
I think this repeal was kind of a thoughtless action , as a matter of fact .
They will have to revisit this issue , and they 'll have to revisit it before long .
Diversification pays .
That 's a fundamental lesson for investors , but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's Friday-the-13th plunge .
Stock funds , like the market as a whole , generally dropped more than 2 % in the week through last Thursday , according to figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc .
That reflects the huge drop a week ago Friday , last Monday 's rebound and the dips and blips that followed .
But several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market 's slide .
Funds that invest internationally were the top-performing stock and fixed-income funds .
`` More than ever , people should realize they should have a diversified portfolio , '' said Jeremy Duffield , a senior vice president of Vanguard Group .
That means stocks , bonds , money market instruments and real estate . ''
One week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision .
But the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough .
`` You want to know how a fund did when the market got hammered , '' said Kurt Brouwer , an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco .
`` It 's like kicking the tires of a car .
What you want to know is when the road 's rough , when there 's snow and ice , how 's this car going to perform ? ''
General equity funds fell an average of 2.35 % in the week ended Thursday , compared with a 2.32 % slide for the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index .
But Lipper Analytical 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock market 's gyrations .
Gold-oriented funds , for instance , which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal , posted an average decline of 1.15 % .
Flexible portfolio funds , which allocate investments among stocks , bonds and money-market instruments and other investments , declined at about half the rate of stock funds -- an average drop of 1.27 % , according to Lipper .
Global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25 % of their portfolios outside the U.S .
This gives them the added benefits of international diversification -- including a foreign-exchange boost during periods , like the past week , when the dollar declines against other major currencies .
With all that going for them , global flexible portfolio funds declined only 1.07 % in the week through last Thursday .
But while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough , there 's also a price to pay : A diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot .
And Friday the 13th notwithstanding , stocks have been this year 's hot investment .
Thus , even including the latest week , the average general stock fund has soared more than 24 % so far this year , the Lipper Analytical figures show .
By comparison , global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19 % , while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17 % .
Fixed-income funds have returned 8.2 % , while gold funds , which tend to be volatile , have risen just 4.55 % , on average .
`` That 's the problem with trying to hedge too much , '' said Mr. Brouwer .
You do n't make any real money . ''
Over the last 20 years , for example , Mr. Brouwer says , an investor putting $ 5,000 a year in the S&P 500 would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in Treasury bills .
Some equity funds did better than others in the week that began on Friday the 13th .
The $ 4 million Monetta Fund , for instance , was the seventh top performing fund for the week , with a 2.65 % return .
Its return so far this year has been a credible 21.71 % .
The fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock appreciates 30 % over its cost .
By the time the market plummeted 10 days ago , Monetta was 55 % in cash , said Robert Bacarella , president and portfolio manager .
Last Monday , he started `` buying the high-quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices . ''
Among Mr. Bacarella 's picks : Oracle Systems , Reebok International Ltd. and Digital Microwave Corp .
The fund 's cash position is now about 22 % , which Mr. Bacarella calls `` still bearish . ''
Among the big stock funds , Dreyfus Fund , with more than $ 2 billion in assets , had a decline of just 1.49 % for the week and a return of 21.42 % for the year .
Howard Stein , chairman of Dreyfus Corp. , said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on Oct. 13 , and about 10 % in cash .
`` In a downward market , bonds act better , '' he said .
`` We still think there 's a lot of unsettlement in this market .
We believe interest rates will continue to trend lower , and the economy will slow around the world . ''
Many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas , giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak .
From its high point on Thursday , Oct. 12 , to where it traded late in New York a week later , the dollar fell 3.6 % against the West German mark , 3.4 % against the British pound and 2.1 % against the Japanese yen .
Three International Cash Portfolios funds , which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas , were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week .
Because the funds ' investments are denominated in foreign currencies , their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar .
But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies , as it did for much of this year , the dollar value of these funds declines .
All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date .
Of the funds that fared the worst in the post-Oct . 13 week , two are heavily invested in airlines stocks , which led the market slide following problems with financing for the UAL Corp . buy-out plan .
Reflecting airline takeover activity , however , both the Fidelity Select Air Transportation Portfolio and the National Aviation & Technology fund posted better-than-average returns for the the year to date : 30.09 % for the Fidelity Air Transportation fund and a whopping 47.24 % for National Aviation & Technology .
The small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign , said A. Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical .
Noting that equity funds are up nearly 60 % from their post-crash low on Dec. 3 , 1987 , he said that what happened last week `` may not be enough of an adjustment .
There 's either more to come or an extremely long period of dullness . ''
But investors do n't seem to think so .
Several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th .
Vanguard Group said it had a more than $ 50 million net inflow into its stock funds last week .
`` There certainly has n't been a panic reaction , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates .
People showed some staying power and , in fact , interest in buying equities . ''

Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance PLC , a major British composite insurer , said it is taking a stake in Nationwide Anglia Building Society 's estate agency business as part of a plan to create a range of commercial linkages in the U.K. and Europe .
Officials declined to disclose the value of the transaction or the exact stake that GRE will hold in Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents .
But the companies said that Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents will market GRE life insurance , pension and investment products through its more than 1,000 retail outlets in the U.K .
Besides the marketing agreement , GRE said Nationwide Anglia has agreed to develop life insurance products with the composite insurer .
Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant , architect William McDonough seems oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting .
He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts .
`` Look how much air is moving around '' he says .
`` The ventilation here is great ''
You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air .
After years of relative obscurity , he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture .
Mr. McDonough believes that the well-being of the planet depends on such stratagems as opening windows to cut indoor air pollution , tacking down carpets instead of using toxic glues , and avoiding mahogany , which comes from endangered rain forests .
He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant -- `` architecturally impeccable , '' Progressive Architecture magazine called it -- and his remodeling of Paul Stuart , the Madison Avenue clothing store .
He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space .
He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts .
What really stirs his muse , though , is aerobic architecture .
Now the question is : Is Poland ready for it ?
Mr. McDonough is about to tackle his biggest clean-air challenge yet , the proposed Warsaw Trade Center in Poland , the first such center in Eastern Europe .
The project has already acquired a certain New York cachet .
Bloomingdale 's plans to sell a foot-tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays .
Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS .
A cake topped with a replica of the center will be auctioned at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby 's in December .
If Mr. McDonough 's plans get executed , as much of the Polish center as possible will be made from aluminum , steel and glass recycled from Warsaw 's abundant rubble .
A 20-story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space .
Solar-powered batteries will make the spire glow .
The windows will open .
The carpets wo n't be glued down , and walls will be coated with nontoxic finishes .
To the extent that the $ 150 million budget will allow it , Mr. McDonough will rely on solid wood , rather than plywood or particle board , to limit the emission of formaldehyde .
If Mr. McDonough has his way , the Poles will compensate for the trade center 's emissions of carbon dioxide , a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear .
The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $ 150,000 , with the center 's developer footing the bill .
The news has n't exactly moved others in Mr. McDonough 's profession to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds .
All architects want to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work , says John Burgee , whose New York firm is designing the redevelopment of Times Square , `` but we ca n't all carry it to that extreme . ''
Karen Nichols , senior associate at Michael Graves 's architecture firm in Princeton , N.J. , says : `` We 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do readily . ''
Mr. McDonough responds : `` I 'm asking people to broaden their agendas . ''
The son of a Seagram 's executive who was stationed in many countries around the world , Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights , Ohio , before entering Dartmouth College .
He earned a master 's degree in architecture from Yale .
His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth .
He and his father still spend time each summer fly-fishing for salmon in Iceland .
Living in Hong Kong , he says , made him sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies .
At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers .
He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont .
At Yale , he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland .
Mr. McDonough 's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York .
The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big , operable windows .
Since the 1970s energy crisis , some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect : high indoor pollution .
To reduce it at the fund 's building , workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director 's office .
Jute , rather than a synthetic material , lies under the tacked-down carpets , and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic .
The budget was only $ 400,000 .
`` Athens with Spartan means , '' Mr. McDonough says .
The fund 's lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees .
Economists and administrators sit along a `` boulevard '' with street lamps and ficus trees .
In offices , triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight .
Offices with outside windows have inside windows , too , to let in more real daylight .
`` We proved a healthy office does n't cost more , '' says Frederic Krupp , executive director of the fund .
It `` really looks beautiful and is very light , '' says Ann Hornaday , a free-lance writer who has visited the office for lunch meetings .
But , she says , `` I guess I did n't really notice the trees .
Maybe they were hidden by all the people . ''
Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the Paul Stuart renovation reflects much of Mr. McDonough 's environmental concern .
The restaurant was conceived as a sparkling , crystalline `` geode . ''
It makes extensive use of stainless steel , silver and aluminum that sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc-strip floors .
To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used for paneling at Paul Stuart , however , Mr. McDonough and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country .
The ambitious Warsaw project still awaits approval by city officials .
Its developer is a Polish American , Sasha Muniak .
He had worked with Mr. McDonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center .
The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment , not readily accessible in Poland now , for a growing number of Westerners doing business in Eastern Europe .
Mr. McDonough thinks of the center as the `` Eiffel Tower of Warsaw '' and `` a symbol of the resurgence of Poland . ''
If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture , it is Poland .
Jessica Mathews , vice president of World Resources Institute in Washington , D.C. , says that perhaps a quarter of Poland 's soil is too contaminated for safe farming because of air pollution .
The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that date back to the Middle Ages .
The future of the forest remains uncertain .
Mr. Muniak 's company , Balag Ltd. , has agreed to set aside the money to plant and maintain it , but discussions are still going on over where to place it and how to ensure that it will be maintained .
After all , Mr. Muniak says , `` in Poland there are n't too many people worried about the environment .
They 're more worried about bread on the table .
Pittston Co. 's third-quarter net income plunged 79 % , reflecting the impact of a prolonged and bitter labor strike at its coal operations .
Net sank to $ 3.1 million , or eight cents a share , including $ 789,000 , or two cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward .
In the year-ago quarter , net totaled $ 14.7 million , or 38 cents a share , including $ 4 million , or 10 cents a share , reflecting a tax-loss carry-forward .
Revenue slipped 0.7 % to $ 395.3 million from $ 398.3 million .
Pittston also owns Brink 's Inc. , the security service , and Burlington Air Express , the air-freight concern .
In addition to expected losses tied to the labor strike , the coal group has spent almost $ 20 million since the strike began for security , the company said .
As a result , the group 's third-quarter loss widened to $ 9.8 million from the second quarter 's $ 3.6 million .
Pittston continues to hire replacement workers , the company said .
Burlington 's operating profit grew to $ 9.2 million from $ 3.8 million a year earlier , Pittston said .
While `` the tone '' of domestic and international air-freight markets remains sound , seasonal factors are likely to hinder Burlington Air from matching third-quarter results in the fourth quarter , Pittston said .
Brink 's operating profit was about flat with the year-earlier period , reflecting continued pricing and cost pressures .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Pittston closed at $ 18.50 a share , down 12.5 cents .
Does n't anybody here want to win this mayor 's race ?
As they stumble and bumble toward election day two weeks from tomorrow , both Democrat David Dinkins and Republican Rudolph Giuliani are in trouble .
Mr. Dinkins , the Manhattan borough president , can afford more bumbling and stumbling because he holds a comfortable 20-point lead in most of the public-opinion polls .
But , in the past 10 days , he has taken a series of body blows to his pride and his reputation that could adversely affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become New York 's first black mayor .
Ordinarily , a clever opponent would find a way to capitalize on the other side 's misfortunes .
But Mr. Giuliani , a celebrated prosecutor , has had difficulty switching from his crime-busting , finger-pointing mode to a political stance that suggests he might know something about running this big , troubled city .
And now , at the crucial moment , he 's running out of money .
This is the nation 's biggest city and , , its mayor is the nation 's best-known urban politician .
Democrats hoped that Mr. Dinkins could become a highly visible national leader .
Republicans figured that in Mr. Giuliani , the nation 's best-known prosecutor , they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of Democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star .
But it has n't worked out that way .
`` Dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy , '' says David Garth , veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for Mayor Edward Koch , defeated by Mr. Dinkins in the Sept. 12 Democratic primary .
The alternative -- Giuliani -- is ghastly . ''
`` I guess we 'll reluctantly go ahead and do it , vote for Dinkins , '' says Richard Wade , a politically active professor who supported Richard Ravitch , an also-ran in the Democratic primary .
There 's nothing on the other side . ''
`` We 're picking up steam , '' insists Roger Ailes , Mr. Giuliani 's media consultant , whose last big campaign helped put George Bush in the White House .
He adds : `` It just has n't gotten down to the engine room yet . ''
But the steam may never reach the engine room .
For , just as Mr. Giuliani latches on to an issue that has Mr. Dinkins reeling , his campaign desperately needs cash to keep Mr. Ailes 's commercials on the air beyond Wednesday or Thursday .
To help out this week , the White House is dispatching chief of staff John Sununu and three Cabinet members -- HUD 's Jack Kemp , Transportation 's Samuel Skinner and Treasury 's Nicholas Brady , according to Peter Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager .
For Republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes , all of this is deeply frustrating .
Historically , New York is almost always in trouble .
But the trouble it faces now under Democratic rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything it has faced in the past .
This year , the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year .
And hardly surprising , many residents trying to cope with the city 's other problems are constantly on edge , one ethnic group scrapping with another .
`` People were n't so happy in the 1930s , '' says Thomas Lessner , another local professor and the biographer of the legendary Fiorello LaGuardia , the city 's fusion mayor who built a coalition Mr. Giuliani hopes to emulate .
But , at least , back then they did n't generally direct their anger at each other . ''
The 62-year-old Mr. Dinkins , an ex-Marine , has served as the city clerk and as Manhattan borough president , a job with limited executive responsibilities -LRB- `` I `` I defy you to come up with one major accomplishment of David Dinkins , '' says Mr. Giuliani . -RRB-
He defeated the contentious Mr. Koch in the Democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could heal the city 's racial and ethnic wounds .
His general-election campaign is almost Reagan-like , all muted pictures and comforting words .
His theme is unity , decency , humanity , bringing New York together again .
Both candidates are negotiating about holding debates , but Mr. Dinkins is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them .
The 45-year-old Mr. Giuliani has run a negative campaign to pick up votes leaning to Mr. Dinkins .
`` He 's got to get Dinkins 's negatives up , '' says Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion .
`` But our polls show voters do n't like the attack stuff .
Why , even 20 % of the Republican vote is going to Dinkins . ''
`` It 's assault-weapons politics , '' says John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , insisting there is a strong racist undertone to the Giuliani effort .
For the Giuliani forces , it 's a conundrum .
On the one hand , Mr. Giuliani wants to cut into Mr. Dinkins 's credibility .
On the other , he seeks to convince voters he 's the new Fiorello LaGuardia -- affable , good-natured and ready to lead New York out of the mess it 's in
It has n't helped that he 's waffled on abortion and gay rights , sought the support of both the Liberal and Conservative parties -LRB- he won the Liberal endorsement -RRB- and that he turned to comedian Jackie Mason for help with Jewish voters .
Mr. Mason left the campaign after telling reporters Mr. Dinkins is `` a fancy'shvartzer ' with a moustache . ''
Shvartzer is a derogatory Yiddish word for a black person .
Mr. Dinkins concedes nothing in his ability to stumble and bumble .
He can match Jackie Mason with his own Robert `` Sonny '' Carson , an angry street organizer who was convicted of kidnapping in 1974 .
The Dinkins campaign paid Mr. Carson close to $ 10,000 to get out the vote on primary-election day .
Paper work on how it was spent is incomplete .
Mr. Carson has been charged with being anti-Semitic .
Asked about that the other day , he replied , `` Anti-Semitic ?
I 'm anti-white . ''
More troubling for Mr. Dinkins is his record in personal accounting .
It began in 1973 , when he was being considered for deputy mayor , and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years .
`` I was always going to do it tomorrow , '' he explained at the time .
And now he 's busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in Inner City Broadcasting Co. , headed by his old friend and patron , Percy Sutton , to his son , David Dinkins Jr. , for $ 58,000 .
He had valued the shares at more than $ 1 million two years earlier .
He says he sold the stock to avoid conflict-of-interest problems in his role as a voting member of the city 's Board of Estimate .
He says his son has n't paid for the shares .
`` It looks like serious tax evasion , '' says Mr. Ailes , the Giuliani media consultant .
`` It follows the same pattern as his tax returns .
He waits to talk about it until after he gets caught . ''
`` He simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ 58,000 two years later , '' says Mr. Powers , the Giuliani campaign manager .
It 's ludicrous for him to suggest it 's the difference between the'breakup ' value of the shares and their market value . ''
So far though , no one -- not even former U.S. attorney Giuliani -- has been able to pinpoint just what law Mr. Dinkins has broken or just what tax he has evaded .
`` The crime goes to character , '' says Ron Maiorana , a consultant to the Giuliani campaign .
It 's serious stuff .
He evades and ducks .
He 's had a history of deception and this is the latest chapter . ''
`` It makes people think , maybe this guy is n't so squeaky clean after all , '' says Mr. Garth , Mayor Koch 's media consultant .
The result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think .
The long-running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano was reignited by the arrest last week of Rome businessman Flavio Carboni on fraud charges .
Rome magistrates accuse Mr. Carboni and several other people of trying to extort 1.2 billion lire -LRB- $ 880,000 -RRB- from the Vatican in return for documents contained in the briefcase of Roberto Calvi , the Ambrosiano chairman found hanged under London 's Blackfriar 's Bridge shortly before the bank 's collapse .
Banco Ambrosiano , which was Italy 's largest private-sector bank , collapsed in 1982 with $ 1.3 billion of debts .
Most of the money was lent to a series of shell companies in Panama and Luxembourg that were owned , directly or indirectly , by the Vatican bank .
The Vatican , which denies any wrongdoing , paid $ 250 million to the Milan bank 's creditors as a `` goodwill gesture '' in 1985 .
Italian news reports said Mr. Carboni and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a Vatican official , Pavel Hnilica .
Italian papers speculated the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the Vatican bank from blame in the scandal , or showing that the bank , known as the Istituto per le Opere di Religione , channeled funds to East bloc groups such as Solidarity in Poland .
Neither Mr. Hnilica , Mr. Carboni nor Vatican officials could be reached for comment over the weekend .
This business trust company said its board elected Kieran E. Burke , a consultant to Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. , as chief executive officer , a new post , and as president .
Mr. Burke succeeds Richard D. Manley , who will remain as a consultant to the company .
Both men were unavailable to comment .
The company also named Michael E. Gellert , a director and a major shareholder , to fill the vacant seat of chairman .
Britain 's Serious Fraud Office said it will investigate the circumstances surrounding alleged phantom contracts at Ferranti International Signal PLC 's International Signal & Control unit .
The investigation , which will be coordinated with one already under way in the U.S. , follows the discovery of what Ferranti has called a `` serious '' fraud involving its U.S. subsidiary .
International Signal & Control , Lancaster , Pa. , a defense-equipment manufacturer , was bought by Ferranti in 1987 for # 420 million -LRB- $ 670.3 million -RRB- .
Ferranti has said that it would be forced to write off # 185 million against the phantom contracts , reducing its net asset value by more than half .
The Serious Fraud Office , a division of London 's Metropolitan Police responsible for investigating financial crimes , said its work would take in `` allegations of fraud prior to , surrounding and subsequent to the merger . ''
Ferranti said that it welcomes the investigation and that it will `` cooperate fully . ''
Derek Alun-Jones , Ferranti 's chairman , has said he hoped to pursue legal action against those responsible .
The British defense electronics group has said it will sell # 100 million in assets and may seek a merger to strengthen itself in the wake of its troubles .
Chicago businessmen Bertram M. Lee and Peter Bynoe signed a new agreement to purchase the Denver Nuggets basketball team , but not as principal owners .
On Saturday , the partners said the team would be purchased for $ 54 million by a new group including Comsat Video Enterprises Inc. , a unit of Communications Satellite Corp. based here .
Comsat Video will pay $ 17 million for a 62.5 % interest , with Messrs. Lee and Bynoe putting up $ 8 million for a 37.5 % stake in the team .
Under terms of the sale , Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker could receive up to $ 11 million in additional payments from the franchise 's future earnings .
Messrs. Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal that would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise .
But the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing .
Comsat Video is headed by Robert Wussler , who resigned his No. 2 executive post with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. just two weeks ago to take the Comsat position .
Comsat Video , which distributes pay-per-view programs to hotel rooms , plans to add Nuggets games to their offerings , as Mr. Turner did successfully with his Atlanta Hawks and Braves sports teams .
Messrs. Lee and Bynoe will manage the Nuggets ' day-today affairs .
Royal Business Group Inc. said it filed suit in federal court here charging Realist Inc. and its directors with violating federal securities laws `` by engaging in a scheme to prevent '' Royal from acquiring Realist .
Royal , which makes and distributes business forms , owns an 8 % stake in Realist .
Royal contends that Realist failed to disclose material information , including Realist 's negotiations to acquire Ammann Laser Technik AG , to stockholders prior to Realist 's June 6 annual meeting .
Royal 's suit contends that the Ammann acquisition was `` designed to entrench management and thwart Royal 's offer . ''
Royal withdrew its offer to buy Realist , a maker of optical and electronic products based in Menomonee Falls , Wis. , for $ 14.06 a share in July after Realist disclosed the Ammann purchase .
The suit seeks `` in excess of $ 350,000 in damages . ''
A Realist official said the company had n't yet received the full complaint and would n't have a response until it had an opportunity to review it .
Winnebago Industries Inc. , battered by a deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales , reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend in half .
The Forest City , Iowa , maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $ 11.3 million , or 46 cents a share , in the quarter ended Aug. 26 .
A year earlier , the company had a deficit of $ 1.5 million , or six cents a share .
The cut in the dividend to 10 cents a share semiannually , from 20 cents , `` would indicate to me they do n't see the problems being fixed real quick , '' said Frank Rolfes , an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis .
Indeed , Winnebago said it started `` several promotional programs '' to spur retail sales in the fall and winter .
The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry , which makes products such as motor homes , travel trailers , folding campers and van conversions .
With the exception of van conversions , the industry has seen a decline from 1988 's robust sales .
But the rate of the decline snowballed in August , with unit sales to dealers for the month down 10.5 % from a year earlier , according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association .
At Winnebago , sales for the quarter fell 6 % to $ 89.5 million from $ 95.4 million a year earlier .
The company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers .
`` It 's a large-ticket discretionary purchase , '' said Robert Curran , who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch & Co .
So when there 's talk and concern about the economy , it 's not unreasonable for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases . ''
Mr. Curran expects industry RV sales for all of 1989 to fall about 5 % from 1988 , when sales of 427,300 units were the highest since 1978 .
And he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year .
But he said the industry has `` a good decade ahead , '' particularly if aging baby boomers fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying RVs .
Winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25 % industrywide in August , and 10.4 % in the first eight months of the year .
The company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs , losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle , among other things .
The news sent Winnebago stock falling 62.5 cents , to $ 5.25 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading-a 52-week low .
The dividend cut will prove most costly for John K. Hanson , Winnebago 's founder and chairman .
Based on his control of about 45 % of Winnebago 's 24.7 million shares , his annual dividend income would be cut to about $ 2.2 million from $ 4.4 million .
For the year , Winnebago had a loss of $ 4.7 million , or 19 cents a share , following profit of $ 2.7 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier .
Sales rose 2 % to $ 437.5 million from $ 430.3 million .
Bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again .
As the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative .
And that , they say , will be good for bonds .
`` Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity , '' said Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities .
Mr. Platt is advising clients that `` the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward . ''
Analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market , which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge , bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the Federal Reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks .
That would be comforting to fixed-income investors , many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease .
Investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall .
But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the Fed 's credit-easing policy was on hold , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled .
Long-term bonds have performed erratically this year .
For example , a group of long-term Treasury bonds tracked by Merrill Lynch & Co. produced a total return of 1 % in the first quarter , 12.45 % in the second quarter and % in the third quarter .
Total return is price changes plus interest income .
Now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins .
Among other things , economists note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed .
At the same time , last week 's consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating .
Add it all up and it means `` that the Fed has a little leeway to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of rekindling inflation , '' said Norman Robertson , chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh .
I think we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by year end . ''
The federal funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , is considered an early signal of changes in the Fed 's credit policy .
Economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the Fed from around 9 % , where it had been since July , to about 8 % in early October on the heels of a weak employment report .
Although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred Oct. 13 , it ended Friday at about 8 % .
James Kochan , chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch , is touting shorter-term securities , which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall .
`` Given our forecast for lower rates , purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end , '' he said .
Mr. Kochan also likes long-term , investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term Treasurys .
He says these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets , seek safer securities .
`` If the -LCB- Tennessee Valley Authority -RCB- sale is any guide , there appears to be good demand for top-quality , long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts , '' he said .
TVA , in its first public debt offering in 15 years , sold $ 4 billion of long-term and intermediate-term securities last week .
Strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion .
TVA , which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems , is a corporation owned by the federal government .
But persuading investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week , when the U.S. government will auction more than $ 30 billion of new securities .
Today , the Treasury Department will sell $ 15.6 billion of three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction .
Tomorrow , the Treasury will sell $ 10 billion of two-year notes .
Resolution Funding Corp. , known as Refcorp , a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations , will hold its first bond auction Wednesday , when it will sell $ 4.5 billion of 30-year bonds .
All of this comes ahead of the government 's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt , which takes place sometime in November .
So far , investors have n't shown much appetite for Refcorp 's initial bond offering .
Roger Early , a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Corp. , said that yields on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention .
`` Why should I bother with something that 's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield ? '' he said .
`` I 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out . ''
He seems to be typical of many professional money managers .
When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began , the bailout bonds were yielding about percentage point more than the Treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond .
On Friday , the yield was quoted at about percentage point higher than the benchmark bond , an indication of weak demand .
Some economists believe that yields on all Treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply .
But once the new securities are digested , they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data .
`` The supply is not a constraint to the market , '' said Samuel Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc .
If one thinks that rates are going down , you do n't care how much supply is coming . ''
Friday 's Market Activity
Most bond prices fell on concerns about this week 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline .
Junk bond prices moved higher , however .
In early trading , Treasury bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among Japanese investors would continue .
Also providing support to Treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks .
Those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance .
Treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as point , or about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The benchmark 30-year bond , which traded as high as 102 during the day , ended at 101 .
The yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to 7.98 % from 7.96 % .
In the corporate bond market , traders said the new-issue market for junk bonds is likely to pick up following Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. 's $ 475 million junk bond offering Friday .
Today , for example , underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co. said they expect to price a $ 150 million , 12-year senior subordinated debenture offering by Imo Industries Inc .
Traders expect the issue to be priced to yield 12 % .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $ 150 million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected by the end of the month .
However , despite the big new-issue calendar , many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get done .
`` There are about a dozen more deals coming , '' said Michael McNamara , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc .
If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western , they are going to have an awful time with the rest . ''
Last week , underwriters were forced to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market .
And pressure by big investors forced Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. to sweeten Chicago & North Western 's $ 475 million junk bond offering .
After hours of negotiating that stretched late into Thursday night , underwriters priced the 12-year issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures at par to yield 14.75 % , higher than the 14.5 % that had been expected .
The coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of 101 .
However , the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is 15.50 % .
Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in Chicago & North Western 's parent company .
`` The coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the fence to come in , '' said a spokesman for Donaldson .
We put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done . ''
The spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors .
In the secondary , or resale , market , junk bonds closed point higher , while investment-grade corporate bonds fell to point .
Sotheby 's Inc. 's gamble in the art-dealing business appears to have paid off .
The New York arm of the London-based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr. , the Campbell 's Soup Co. heir , for $ 131 million last week , a record for a single-owner art collection .
That total was below the $ 140 million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for , but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement Sotheby 's had made with the Dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house .
Sotheby 's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ 100 million , and as much as $ 120 million , to obtain the collection , people familiar with the transaction said , thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold .
The Dorrance estate , auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days , included porcelains , furniture and paintings .
An Henri Matisse , auctioned last Wednesday , fetched $ 12.4 million , a world record for the artist .
In addition , a handful of paintings from the Dorrance collection remain to be sold at Sotheby 's annual old masters paintings auction in January .
The Better Business Bureau of San Diego and the state Attorney General 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau-sponsored business directories published by an outside firm , Better Book Inc .
The settlement stems from charges that Better Book , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986 .
Without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories .
The conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale .
The Attorney General 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau-sponsored directory project contracted by Better Book .
The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987 .
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said it obtained `` firm '' financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its offer for 50.3 % of LIN Broadcasting Corp .
Morgan Guaranty Trust , Toronto-Dominion Bank and Provident National Bank , an affiliate of PNC Financial Corp. , jointly committed $ 1.2 billion of financing , subject to certain conditions , McCaw said .
Further , McCaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $ 4.5 billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks .
Morgan , Toronto-Dominion and Provident are leading that syndicate .
McCaw is offering to buy 22 million shares of LIN for $ 125 each in cash , which would result in McCaw owning 50.3 % of the cellular-phone and broadcasting concern .
The offer is in limbo , however , because LIN has agreed to merge its cellular-phone businesses with BellSouth Corp .
In national over-the-counter trading Friday , LIN shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $ 110.625 .
Beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and for severe punishment , including the death sentence , for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution .
The official Xinhua News Agency said the municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its first anti-prostitution statutes .
It quoted Liu Changyi , deputy director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau , as saying that there were many more people involved in prostitution now than in 1985 , when there were about 100 cases .
Foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according to the law , and those with sexually transmitted diseases will be expelled from the country , according to the regulations .
The Communists nearly succeeded in eliminating prostitution after taking over in 1949 , but the practice has returned in recent years with the country 's increased exposure to the outside world .
Japan agreed to enforce a decision by an international wildlife conference to ban all trade in ivory , a spokesman for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said .
Earlier , Japan had said it might file a reservation against the ivory ban decided by ballot at the 103-nation United Nations Conference on International Trade in Endangered Species in Switzerland last week .
The Japanese use 40 % of the world 's ivory .
Italy should close the Leaning Tower of Pisa because it 's a danger to tourists , government-appointed experts said .
`` In some places the stonework is so damaged it shows signs of breaking off , '' scientists and technicians said in a report to Public Works Minister Giovanni Prandini .
Each year , nearly a million people pay about $ 3 to make the spiral climb up 294 steps to the top of the 800-year-old marble tower .
East Germany pledged to reduce alcohol consumption by boosting production of soft drinks and fruit juices .
Trade and Supply Minister Gerhard Briksa said in a letter published in the youth daily Junge Welt that the rise in alcohol consumption in East Germany had been halted ; but to reduce it further , he said , production and supply of other beverages , including fruit juices , should be stepped up .
He added that shops will have to continue reducing their stocks of liquor and avoid displaying them too prominently in the window .
Hong Kong has built a detention center for illegal immigrants from China because China has refused for the past two weeks to accept them back .
The center , close to Hong Kong 's border with China , will be ready today and will be able to house 1,000 inmates , Police Deputy Director Peter Wong said .
The dispute started when China , angry that Hong Kong had allowed dissident swimmer Yang Yang to flee to the U.S. , halted the usual daily transfer of illegal immigrants caught in this British colony , which reverts to Beijing 's control in 1997 .
Sweating under the glare of newly installed television lights , British members of Parliament demanded a halt to the experimental televising of debates .
A group of senior Conservative legislators , complaining the House of Commons was like a sauna , demanded that the experiment be stopped unless the intensity of the lights is reduced .
One Conservative MP , David Wilshire , said : `` I should have a wonderful suntan by Christmas . ''
Debates are due to be broadcast nationally starting Nov. 21 in a six-month experiment .
A majority of Japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to Mexico under the Brady plan because they 're uncertain the Mexican economy will remain stable .
Instead , many small and medium-sized banks , and some larger ones , are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan , Japanese banking officials said .
The plan , proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Nicholas Brady , calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans .
The officials said that most Japanese banks prefer the losses they 'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending .
But an official at a long-term credit bank explained that since some larger banks have already taken loss provisions for loans to other Third World nations , further write-offs could be viewed as intolerable .
`` They ca n't take the hit '' to their earnings , he said .
As a result , the official said , they may be forced into a no-win situation in which they make risky loans that they could have to write off later .
A poll in male-dominated South Korea put Margaret Thatcher first on a list of most-respected foreign leaders .
The British prime minister was the only woman singled out by respondents , who put Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in second place .
The Soviet newspaper Trud reported that Mickey Mouse will appear in a Russian-language comic book to be issued four times a year by Soviet publisher Fizkultura i Sport and Denmark 's Gutenberghus Group .
The comic book will cost about $ 2 .
Ekco Group Inc. , Nashua , N.H. , expects to report that net income in the third quarter , ended Oct. 1 , fell 50 % to 60 % from $ 2.1 million , or 11 cents a share , a year earlier .
Robert Stein , president and chief executive officer , attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a two-week strike last month at the company 's Masillon , Ohio , bakeware facility .
Softer-than-expected orders in early September also played a role , he said in an interview .
But Mr. Stein said he is `` reasonably confident '' that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ 3.1 million , or 17 cents a share , in 1988 .
That would require fourth-quarter net of more than about 22 cents to 24 cents a share , assuming that Mr. Stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate .
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , the company had profit of $ 2.7 million , or 15 cents a share .
Third-quarter revenue is expected to be $ 40 million to $ 45 million , up from $ 38.2 million a year earlier , according to Neil Gordon , treasurer .
The year-earlier periods do n't reflect results of the company 's Woodstream Corp. unit , acquired last January , but include some Canadian operations that were sold at the end of 1988 .
August through October traditionally is the busiest season for the bakeware business , as many retailers use the goods as autumn promotional items .
Mr. Stein said some retailers -- perhaps anxious about minimizing inventories -- appear to have held back on orders in September but have been ordering more heavily in October .
Mr. Stein said Woodstream is `` marginally profitable '' but has n't performed as well as expected .
Woodstream 's Victor-brand mousetraps and other pest-control products are `` doing very well , '' and its plastic storage-case products `` are poised for growth , '' he said .
But the unit 's third segment , wildlife traps , is suffering from a `` depressed market , '' and Ekco is seeking to sell that segment , he said .
Mr. Stein said he expects profit to be higher in 1990 than in 1989 , reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of Ekco Housewares in late 1987 .
Prior to acquiring the housewares business , the company was known as Centronics Corp. ; Centronics had been a maker of computer printers , but Mr. Stein and other officers decided to sell that business after Japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market . -RRB-
Mr. Stein said tighter operating controls have enabled Ekco to reduce inventory levels 25 % to 30 % ; improve on-time delivery of orders to about 95 % from around 70 % ; and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit .
By moving the design of new products in-house -- instead of contracting out the work -- the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently , he said .
In addition to those measures , the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers ' retail outlets -- a strategy that Mr. Stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands .
Ekco 's housewares operation makes kitchen tools and gadgets , as well as bakeware , at factories in the U.S. and Canada .
The main issue in the strike at the Ohio facility was health-care benefits , Mr. Stein said .
The strike ended Oct .
Ekco continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry , Mr. Stein said .
He indicated that Ekco may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $ 75 million to $ 100 million , partly because mass merchandisers increasingly want to rely on larger , and fewer , suppliers .
After several years of booming business with China , foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade .
The imposition of austerity measures , starting last October , already had begun to pinch when the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt far tighter .
Foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then , choking liquidity and hobbling many projects .
And Beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies , leaving many domestic buyers and export-oriented plants strapped for cash .
Givaudan Far East Ltd. , a Swiss concern that sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in China , typifies the problems .
Last year 's retrenchment dried up the working capital of Chinese factories .
The company 's sales flattened during 1989 's first half .
The June killings magnified the problems .
In Canton , Givaudan 's representative office received no orders in June .
At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions , but when no orders were logged in August and September , manager Donald Lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months .
`` Things have grown worse since June 4 , '' Mr. Lai says .
He predicts that sales will drop between 30 % and 40 % from last year 's $ 3 million .
The consumer-products and light-industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China 's austerity measures , and foreign companies such as Givaudan that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest .
But in general , all foreign-trading companies are feeling the pinch .
`` The import pie will shrink , '' says John Kamm , first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist .
On the down side , sales could fall as much as 90 % for some companies ; on the upper side , sales will be flat . ''
China 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade .
The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86 , when Beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange .
The current trough is expected to be much deeper , because Beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation .
In addition , the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback .
`` The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading , '' says Raymond Wong , China manager for Mannesmann AG , a West German machinery-trading company .
Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half .
In the first eight months of 1989 , imports grew 21 % , to $ 38.32 billion , down slightly from a growth rate of 23 % a year earlier .
The picture for China 's exports is just as bleak , mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze .
Exports in the first eight months grew only 9 % , to $ 31.48 billion , compared with a growth rate of 25 % a year earlier , according to Chinese customs figures .
The threat to China 's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves , excluding gold holdings .
The reserves dropped for the first time in recent years , to $ 14 billion in June from $ 19 billion in April .
The trend has prompted Beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports .
In recent weeks , China 's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities .
The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses .
Beijing 's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping China export .
For example , Nissho Iwai Corp. , one of the biggest Japanese trading houses , now buys almost twice as many goods from China as it sells to that country .
Three years ago , the ratio was reversed .
But the strategy is n't helping much this time .
`` Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad , '' says Masahiko Kitamura , general manager of Nissho Iwai 's Canton office .
He expects the company 's trading business to drop as much as 40 % this year .
For a short time after June 4 , it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright .
Many foreign trading offices in Hong Kong were swamped with telexes and telephone calls from Chinese trade officials urging them not to sever ties .
Even the Bank of China , which normally took weeks to process letters of credit , was settling the letters at record speed to dispel rumors about the bank 's financial health .
But when foreign traders tried to do business , they discovered that the eagerness of Chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen .
The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of China 's national trading companies , which are among the country 's biggest importers .
Business is n't any better on the provincial or municipal level , foreign traders say .
Shanghai Investment & Trust Co. , known as Sitco , is the city 's main financier for trading business .
Sitco had customarily tapped the Japanese bond market for funds , but it ca n't do that any longer .
Foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash .
`` It has difficulties paying its foreign debts , '' says a Hong Kong executive who is familiar with Sitco 's business .
How can it make available funds for purchases ? ''
Foreign traders also say many of China 's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit .
Albert Lee , a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales , estimates that as many as 70 % of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months .
`` There are virtually no new projects , and that means no new business for us , '' he says .
Even when new lending resumes , foreign exchange would still be tight because Beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing , which has grown between 30 % and 40 % in the past few years .
And foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because China is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years .
Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel , chemical fertilizers and plastics .
These have been among the country 's leading imports , particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly .
But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices .
To stem speculation , Beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year .
Traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock .
The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market .
But Beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country 's export business .
Mr. Kamm , the China trade expert , estimates that as much as 50 % of Guangdong 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials .
Oil Spill Case Shows Liability Fund Flaws
AN UNRESOLVED two-year-old dispute stemming from an Alaskan oil spill has helped spur a drive for tougher federal laws to protect victims of such accidents .
The class-action suit highlights shortcomings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund , which gets its money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills .
On July 2 , 1987 , the tanker S.S. Glacier Bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the Cook Inlet .
Commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that has ballooned to more than $ 104.8 million .
Defendants include British Petroleum America ; Trinidad Corp. , the shipper ; and the pipeline liability fund .
The fund was created by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act , which provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved in an oil spill must pay the first $ 14 million in damages .
The fund is required to pay claims up to an additional $ 86 million .
The fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief .
But the Glacier Bay case , the fund 's first test , shows how easily the fund can be undermined .
Trinidad Corp. is contesting liability .
It claims the Coast Guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages .
That means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything , at least so far .
The Oil Pollution Act , scheduled to come up for a vote in Congress this fall , would provide that if claimants are n't paid within 90 days of a spill , the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel , says a spokesman for Rep. George Miller -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , a sponsor of the bill .
The spokesman says the `` glitch '' in the statute is `` the worst kind of Catch-22 . ''
Many Law School Grads Find Classes Never End
RECENT LAW school graduates are starting jobs with law firms this fall -- and heading back to class .
Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs to teach associates all they need to know about law but did n't learn in law school .
`` Law school teaches wonderful theory , but it does n't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering , '' says Aaron Weitz , head of a New York County Lawyers ' Association committee that sponsors such a course .
In the past , associates learned the basics from senior lawyers who acted as mentors .
But these days , large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year , and it 's impossible to personally train everyone , says Joel Henning of Hildebrandt Inc. , a consulting firm that runs training classes .
The Hildebrandt course enables students to brush up on negotiation skills by role playing in simulated deals .
Students also are taught to return clients ' phone calls immediately and to treat the support staff with respect .
Many law firms sponsor their own programs .
At the Baltimore firm of Weinberg & Green , new corporate and banking associates are required to enroll in a 20-class course .
Partners lecture on how to form corporations , draft agreements and defend clients against unwanted tender offers .
Now , clients know that new associates have had some practical training before working on their cases , says James J. Hanks , a partner at the firm .
Los Angeles Creates A Courthouse for Kids
THE CHILDREN of Los Angeles will soon have their own $ 52 million courthouse .
The building , which will handle child abuse , custody and foster care cases , will be `` less formal , less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses , '' says Edmund Edelman , chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors .
Designs call for an L-shaped structure with a playground in the center .
There will be recreation and movie rooms .
Teens will be able to listen to music with headsets .
Study halls , complete with reference materials , will be available .
And there will be a nurse 's station and rooms for children to meet with social workers .
The building 's 25 courtrooms will be smaller , says Charlene Saunders , a court administrator .
The bench will be lower so the judge seems less intimidating , and walls will be painted in bright colors and covered with murals .
Cases in Los Angeles County involving dependent children are usually heard in the Criminal Courts Building .
`` We need to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment , '' says Mr. Edelman .
About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision , Mr. Edelman says , and an average of 1,500 new children are added each month .
The courthouse , to be built in Monterey Park , is expected to open in the spring of 1992 .
Law Firm Management Can Be Quite Rewarding
IT PAYS to follow a management career path -- even at law firms .
That 's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted by Altman & Weil Inc. , an Ardmore , Pa. , law firm consultant .
Its survey of 96 firms , each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers , shows that managing partners earned an average of $ 395,974 in compensation and cash benefits in the firms ' 1988 fiscal years .
Managing partners who responded to the survey typically spend over half their time supervising their firms ' day-to-day operations and just a little more than a third of their time practicing law .
Partners in the survey who devote most of their time to practicing law earned an average of about $ 217,000 .
Chairman Jamie Whitten -LRB- D. , Miss . -RRB- of the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $ 2.85 billion emergency funding package to assist California 's recovery from last week 's earthquake and extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo .
The sweeping measure incorporates $ 500 million in small-business loans , $ 1 billion in highway-construction funds and $ 1.25 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters .
The funds would be attached to a stop-gap spending bill required to keep most of the government operating past Wednesday .
The measure is scheduled to be taken up by the Appropriations Committee today .
The panel is expected to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package to bolster the share for the Small Business Administration .
`` We will support it , we will thank him , and we will augment it where appropriate , '' said Rep. Vic Fazio -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- .
Dubbed the `` Dire Emergency Supplemental to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance , '' the measure is vintage Whitten in asserting federal responsibility and in disdaining budget impediments .
`` Such other amounts will be made available subsequently as required , '' the legislation reads , and the new obligations `` shall not be a charge against the Budget Act , Gramm-Rudman-Hollings , or other ceilings .
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings of some $ 145 million of Pinnacle debt because of `` accelerating deficiency in liquidity , '' which it said was evidenced by Pinnacle 's elimination of dividend payments .
Henry Sargent Jr. , Pinnacle executive vice president , said the action `` wo n't really have any effect on us .
We are n't selling bonds right now , and I do n't think it will affect the value of our existing bonds . ''
The rating agency said it lowered the ratings on $ 75 million of the holding company 's convertible subordinated Eurodebentures to B-3 from B-1 .
Moody 's said it also lowered the ratings of $ 70 million of Pinnacle 's MeraBank thrift unit long-term deposits to B-3 from B-2 , and on its subordinated debt to Ca from Caa .
MeraBank 's rating for short-term deposits remains Not Prime .
Securities of MeraBank were placed under review last May , and will remain under review for downgrade , the agency said .
First , the somewhat affected idealism of the 1960s .
Then , the all-too-sincere opportunism of the 1970s and 1980s .
What now ?
To judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene , we 're back in the age of anxiety .
Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success , it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks , that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing .
Lisa Zeidner 's third novel , `` Limited Partnerships '' -LRB- North Point Press , 256 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is a stylish , funny and thoughtful look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money , or , more specifically , the lack of it .
Nora Worth and Malcolm DeWitt , 33 and 39 respectively , live together in a townhouse in a transitional Philadelphia neighborhood .
Malcolm , a former film-maker turned architect , has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady , obnoxious client , a fly-by-night real estate developer .
Nora , who still has artistic aspirations , knows she is lucky to be working as a food stylist , prepping pies , burgers , frosty cold drinks and other comestibles to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera .
After all , she reasons , `` there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who would kill for her job . ''
But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped .
They seem to be having the `` worst of both worlds : artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product ; self-employment without fun or profit . ''
It 's a downbeat , `` thirtysomething '' world , in which bright , still youngish people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor , doing free-lance , semi-professional work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be grateful to do .
Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives .
Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit , but Nora finds an extra $ 30,000 in her bank account , suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold .
While she is wondering whether to live it up , and do something even more dramatic , say get married , her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame , David , a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of stardom .
In novels of an earlier vintage , David would have represented excitement and danger ; Malcolm , placid , middle-class security .
The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a `` safe '' middle-class haven : Nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security , with no firm economic base anywhere .
The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a `` middle way '' between the extremes of success and failure , wealth and poverty .
In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation , Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters .
The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts -LRB- even the characters ' own -RRB- are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters .
But readers may well feel the pangs of recognition .
In any case , the foundering middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction .
`` Rascal Money '' -LRB- Contemporary Books , 412 pages , $ 17.95 -RRB- , a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber , tells the story of an innovative , well-run , widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW , a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world .
Patrician dynamic Scott Thatcher , , initially finds the takeover threat risible .
But , as he and his skilled team soon discover , they 're up against two factors they had n't counted on : first , a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover ; second , that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger , shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal .
Mr. Garber manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast-paced action of a suspense novel .
And like a spy or mystery story , this novel has strong elements of allegory , as the good and evil forces battle it out .
Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures .
Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians , snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author 's perceptions .
Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this : If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible , malicious dolt , we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated , and would not be so diverted in the process .

High-definition television promises to be the TV of tomorrow , so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market .
Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to Japan , not everyone here is ready to give up .
A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin , high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s .
With only small help from the government , these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government .
Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio , aims to use a new form of plasma technology to put movie-quality images on a TV display that is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick .
Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton , Ore. , the largest of these firms , with $ 20 million in annual revenue , has similar plans .
It already has had success in electroluminescence , another promising technology adaptable for high-definition television .
Two other firms , Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy , Mich. , and Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat-panel screens called active-matrix liquid crystal displays .
The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube , which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set .
Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television , or HDTV , which is expected to become a $ 30 billion business world-wide within a decade .
Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal-processing and broadcast equipment .
But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays , they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels .
General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid-crystal displays to Thompson-CSF of France .
`` We found the market not developing as we thought it would , '' a GE spokesman says .
The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there to be seized .
`` No one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels '' at commercial costs , says Zvi Yaniv , the president of Ovonic Imaging .
He says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that .
The Bush administration , hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be , is n't doing much for now .
The only material support it is extending to the struggling U.S. industry is $ 30 million in awards from the Pentagon 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending .
The Commerce Department estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion .
`` Unless it gets more help , the U.S. industry wo n't have a chance , '' says Peter Friedman , Photonics 's executive vice president .
Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from U.S. laboratories .
But Peter Brody , Magnascreen 's president , says Japanese companies are poised to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use , just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording .
In the 1970s , Mr. Brody helped develop the first display panels based on active-matrix liquid crystals at Westinghouse Electric Corp. 's research labs in Pittsburgh .
The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image .
In 1979 , however , Westinghouse abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television .
Mr. Brody left the company to find other backers .
He has a claim to the right to commercialize the Westinghouse patents , but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of Japanese producers .
`` Most American investors have just given up , '' Mr. Brody says .
They are n't prepared to compete in an area where the Japanese want to enter . ''
Many critics question the industry 's need for federal support ; the Pentagon justifies its help on national-security grounds .
`` We do n't see a domestic source for some of our -LCB- HDTV -RCB- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says Michael Kelly , director of DARPA 's defense manufacturing office .
So DARPA is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by doling out research funds .
HDTV already has some military applications , such as creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
The Navy is ordering displays for its Aegis cruisers and the Army wants smaller versions for its Abrams battle tanks .
The Commerce Department also is trying to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries .
`` It is n't just yuppie television , '' argues Jack Clifford , director of the department 's office of microelectronics and instrumentation .
The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market . ''
Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research consortia , the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds .
Each claims to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial .
They also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the Pentagon and Commerce department 's concern over their future .
They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers , including Matsushita , Hitachi , and Toshiba , to exempt portable color TVs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the U.S. imposes on the larger Japanese color TVs .
And they want the U.S. to help them sell overseas .
Planar President James Hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15 % to sell his display panels in Japan and South Korea , while panels from those countries enter the U.S. duty-free .
`` This is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , '' he says .
We just have n't learned what it takes to compete .
Burmah Oil PLC , a British independent oil and specialty-chemicals marketing concern , said SHV Holdings N.V. has built up a 7.5 % stake in the company .
The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7 % stake that Burmah announced SHV held as of last Monday .
SHV , of the Netherlands , which last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which owns 40 % of Calor , was identified as a possible suitor for Burmah .
Burmah said it had n't held any discussions with SHV and that `` no deal of any nature is in contemplation .
The top state environmental official in Massachusetts said Clean Harbors Inc. 's environmental-impact statement for a proposed incinerator in Braintree was inadequate .
The official , John DeVillars , asked Clean Harbors for more information before ruling on a permit for the site .
Critics of the plan , including the town of Braintree , say the incinerator is a health hazard .
Clean Harbors , based in Quincy , said it `` will proceed expeditiously '' to submit the data requested .
Alan McKim , chief executive officer of Clean Harbors said he was `` very much encouraged '' by the official 's praise of Clean Harbors for the quality of some of the data in the report .
Citizens & Southern Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Security Pacific Corp. 's New York-based factoring unit .
Terms of the bank holding companies ' agreement were n't disclosed .
Factoring involves the purchase and collection of another company 's receivables .
Citizens , based in Atlanta , said it has about $ 4.6 billion in factored sales annually ; the Security Pacific unit has about $ 1.8 billion annually .
Security Pacific 's factoring business works with companies in the apparel , textile and food industries , among others .
The Office of Thrift Supervision banned B.J. Garman , a former director of the failed Vision Banc Savings Association of Kingsville , Texas , from working in any financial institution insured by the government .
The office , a Treasury Department unit that is the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year 's thrift-bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public .
Generally , regulators have n't announced enforcement actions in the past .
Indeed , the OTS said that before the law took effect Aug. 9 , it banned another `` key Vision Banc insider '' from insured financial institutions .
That individual was n't identified .
Vision Banc was placed in government conservatorship in March , and it operates under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts .
The OTS did n't say specifically why the action was taken against Ms. Garman .
However , it said examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift , including `` extraordinary loan commissions '' paid to a firm associated with Vision Banc officials , and loans diverted through borrowers back to the thrift officials .
Ms. Garman could n't be reached for comment .
Arizona Instrument Corp. said it expects to post a third-quarter net loss of about $ 600,000 , or 25 cents to 27 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 214,000 , or 10 cents a share , a year earlier .
The Tempe , Ariz. , maker of underground fuel-storage systems said the most recent period was affected by customers ' problems complying with recent Environmental Protection Agency regulations .
For the nine months , the company expects to post a net loss of about $ 879,000 , or 35 cents to 40 cents a share , on revenue of $ 6.5 million .
A year earlier , it had a loss of $ 199,203 or nine cents a share , on revenue of $ 7.6 million .
Growth is good .
At least , that 's a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the handsome stock-market gains they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of above-average performers .
They are starting to buy growth stocks .
Remember them ?
The upper echelon of this group were shares of the `` nifty 50 '' companies whose profits of the 1960s and early 1970s grew steadily , if not spectacularly , through thick and thin .
That sort of workhorse performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years .
The current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones .
Those are unwelcome trends in a year that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 23 % so far , even with the 190.58-point plunge on Oct. 13 ; broader market measures are in the same neighborhood .
The question for investors is , how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains .
That 's the path of reasoning leading to growth stocks .
`` I think it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market , '' says Steven Einhorn , partner at Goldman Sachs .
Growth stocks may be as big as Philip Morris or medium-sized such as Circuit City Stores , but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least 15 % to 20 % a year , money managers say .
`` The period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits , '' says Stephen Boesel , president of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income Fund .
Growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility , which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to discern where the economy is heading .
This kind of jumpy uncertainty reminds John Calverley , senior economist for American Express Bank , of the 1969-72 period , when the industrial average rolled through huge ranges and investors flocked to the shares of companies with proven earnings records , which became known as the `` nifty 50 . ''
And they will again , say money-manager proponents of the growth-stock theme .
Cabanne Smith , president of a money management company bearing his name , predicts that investment companies using computers to identify companies with earnings `` momentum '' will climb on the growth-stock bandwagon as the overall corporate earnings outlook deteriorates further .
He also thinks foreign investors , who are showing signs of more discriminate investing , will join the pursuit and pump up prices .
`` We 're just seeing the beginning of a shift , '' Mr. Smith says .
Mr. Smith recommends Cypress Semiconductor that is currently showing a robust 63 % earnings growth rate .
Ronald Sloan , executive vice president of Siebel Capital Management , likes Wellman Inc. , a company that recycles plastic into synthetic fibers for carpeting .
Mr. Sloan praises the company as recession resistant and notes that it has an annual earnings growth rate of 32 % a year over the past five years .
Wellman stock closed Friday at 39 , up ; Mr. Sloan thinks that in a year it could hit 60 .
Others preach the gospel of buying only blue-chip growth stocks .
Carmine Grigoli , chief market strategist for First Boston , who still says , `` We expect the Dow average -LCB- to be at -RCB- 3000 by mid-1990 , '' nonetheless foresees a sluggish economy in the meantime .
He recommends such blue-chip growth stalwarts as Philip Morris , PepsiCo , CPC International , Reebok International , and Limited Inc .
All have a fiveyear earnings growth rate of more than 20 % a year .
Some money managers are pursuing growth stocks at the expense of those that rise and fall along with the economic cycle .
`` One of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy , '' says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price .
James Wright , chief investment officer for Banc One Asset Management , says , `` We 've been selling a disproportionate share of cyclical companies and buying a disproportionate share of high earnings stocks . ''
He recently trimmed his portfolio of International Paper , Dow Chemical , Quantum Chemical , International Business Machines and Digital Equipment .
He is putting money in Dress Barn , Circuit City Stores , Bruno 's , and Rubbermaid .
Big cyclical companies are using `` all the tricks they can to stabilize earnings , '' says Mr. Sloan .
He cites IBM , which reported a 30 % earnings decline in the third quarter , and which last week announced a $ 1 billion buy-back of its shares .
`` What they are telling you is that they do n't have the ability to generate higher returns internally , '' says Mr. Sloan .
`` When they are buying back stock at 10 times earnings , they are suggesting that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below '' returns on the stock .
IBM says it considers its shares a good investment .
But not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on cyclicals .
Growth stocks may underperform cyclical stocks next year if the Federal Reserve begins to let interest rates drift sufficiently lower to boost the economy .
Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Einhorn , for one , subscribes to that scenario .
He suggests investors think about buying cyclical shares in the weeks ahead , as well as growth issues .
Friday 's Market Activity
Stock prices finished about unchanged Friday in quiet expiration trading .
Traders anticipated a volatile session due to the October expiration of stock-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks .
But there were fewer price swings than expected .
Buy order imbalances on several big stocks were posted by the New York Stock Exchange .
But block trading desks and money managers made a concerted effort to meet the imbalances with stock to sell , one trader said .
As a result , the Dow Jones Industrial Average drifted in narrow ranges in the final hour of trading , and closed 5.94 higher to 2689.14 .
New York Stock Exchange volume was 164,830,000 .
Advancers on the Big Board lagged decliners 662 to 829 .
For the week , the industrial average gained 119.88 points , or 4.7 % , the biggest weekly point advance ever and a better than 50 % rebound from the 190.58 point loss the industrial average logged Oct. 13 .
Broader market averages were little changed in the latest session .
Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index gained 0.03 to 347.16 , the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 0.02 to 325.50 , and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.05 to 192.12 .
Most of last week 's surge in the industrial average came on Monday , when the average rose 88.12 points as market players snapped up blue-chip issues and shunned the broad market .
That contrast was reflected in the smaller weekly percentage gains recorded by the broader averages .
The S&P 500 rose 4 % , the Dow Jones Equity Market index gained 3.7 % and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 3.5 % .
The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 32.71 to 1230.80 amid renewed weakness in the airline sector .
UAL skidded 21 to 168 on 2.2 million shares .
On the week , UAL was down nearly 40 % .
The latest drop followed a decision by British Airways , which had supported the $ 300-a-share buy-out offer for UAL from a labor-management group , not to participate in any revised bid .
British Airways fell 1 to 31 .
While most other airline issues took their cue from UAL , USAir Group rose 1 to 43 on 1.5 million shares amid speculation about a possible takeover proposal from investor Marvin Davis .
USA Today reported that Mr. Davis , who had pursued UAL before dropping his bid Wednesday , has acquired a stake of about 3 % in USAir .
Unocal fell 1 to 52 and Burlington Resources declined to 45 .
At a meeting with analysts , British Petroleum officials dispelled speculation that the company may take over a U.S. oil company , according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report .
Both Unocal and Burlington had been seen as potential targets for a British Petroleum bid .
Paper and forest-products stocks declined after Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. lowered investment ratings on a number of issues in the two sectors , based on a forecast that pulp prices will fall sharply .
International Paper dropped to 51 , Georgia-Pacific fell 1 to 56 1 , to to .
Dun & Bradstreet dropped to 51 on 1.9 million shares on uncertainty about the company 's earnings prospects .
Merrill Lynch cut its rating and 1990 earnings estimate Thursday , citing weakness in its credit-rating business .
Lamson & Sessions , which posted sharply lower third-quarter earnings and forecast that results for the fourth quarter might be `` near break-even , '' fell to 9 .
Winnebago Industries slid 5 .
The company , which reported that its loss for the fiscal quarter ended Aug. 26 widened from a year earlier , cut its semiannual dividend in half in response to the earnings weakness .
MassMutual Corporate Investors fell 3 to 29 after declaring a quarterly dividend of 70 cents a share , down from 95 cents a share .
Stoneridge Resources Inc. said it will begin an offering of rights equivalent to 2.6 million common shares and valued at $ 22,750,000 .
The Bloomfield Hills , Mich.-based real-estate holding company said it will offer the rights at $ 8.75 a share to shareholders of record on Oct. 26 .
The offering is scheduled to expire on Nov. 30 .
The company said it will use the proceeds of the offering for debt reduction and general corporate purposes , including acquisitions .
Stockholders may buy one share at the subscription price for every four shares of stock they own .
Stockholders who exercise all their rights may buy additional shares , the company said .
The company said it has an option to increase the offering by up to 350,000 shares .

MCI COMMUNICATIONS Corp. said it filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for issuance of as much as $ 750 million of debt securities .
The debt will include medium-term notes sold through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets ; Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ; Goldman , Sachs & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc .
The funds will be used for refinancing existing debt of the Washington , D.C. , concern at lower interest rates and for other general purposes .
The effective date of the registration is to be determined by the SEC .
A group including ESL Partners Ltd. , a Fort Worth , Texas , investment partnership , and Richard E. Rainwater , a former adviser to the Fort Worth Bass family , said it reduced its stake in Anacomp Inc. to 3.6 % of the common shares outstanding .
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group said it sold 1,325,900 Anacomp common shares from Aug. 31 to last Wednesday for $ 4.48 to $ 5.84 a share , resulting in a drop in its holdings to 1,351,662 shares .
No reason was given in the filing for the sales .
An Anacomp official said the Indianapolis computer-services concern had no comment on the group 's share sales .
In March , the group disclosed it held a 7.2 % stake in Anacomp for investment purposes .
It said then it had had and would continue to have discussions with Anacomp 's management concerning its investment .
Home Beneficial Corp. , Richmond , Va. , said it contracted to sell its 50 % interest in a Richmond-area shopping mall to a buyer that was n't identified .
The life-insurance holding company said the sale would result in an after-tax gain of about $ 32 million , or $ 3.09 a share , in the first quarter of
The company also said it will adopt new accounting standards in the first quarter .

A shareholder filed suit , seeking to block Unitel Video Inc. 's proposed plan to be acquired by a new affiliate of closely held Kenmare Capital Corp. for $ 15 a share , or $ 33.6 million .
The suit , which seeks class-action status , was filed in Delaware Chancery Court .
The complaint alleges that the price is `` unfair and grossly inadequate '' and that the defendants are seeking to ensure a `` lockup '' of the purchase of Unitel , thereby discouraging other bids .
It seeks unspecified money damages .
The New York company called the lawsuit without merit .
Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the transaction Nov .
This Toronto closed-end fund cut the annual dividend on its Class A common shares to one Canadian cent from 10 Canadian cents .
The fund invests mainly in gold and silver bullion .
It said the reduced dividend reflects the low price for precious metals .
Greg Davies , Central Fund 's vice president , finance , said losses for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31 could be as high as one million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 852,000 -RRB- .
The fund last had a profit in 1985 .
The new dividend rate is payable Nov. 15 to holders of record Oct. 31 .

Comair Holdings Inc. said in Cincinnati that it bought Airline Aviation Academy , a pilot training school based at Sanford Regional Airport near Orlando , Fla .
Comair said it paid cash but declined to disclose the price .
Comair Holdings is the parent of Comair Inc. , a regional air carrier .
Airline Aviation , which has annual revenue of $ 5 million to $ 6 million , has great growth potential because of the large number of U.S. pilots nearing retirement age , Comair said .
The unit will be renamed Comair Aviation Academy and will continue to be headed by Scott Williams , a son of its founder , Comair said .
The collapse of a $ 6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has handed Wall Street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal .
Their $ 700 million-plus in estimated paper losses easily tops the $ 400 million in paper losses the takeover traders , known as arbitragers , suffered in 1982 when Gulf Oil Co. dropped a $ 4.8 billion offer for Cities Service Co .
In the six trading days since the UAL labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing , culminating Friday with the withdrawal of its partner British Airways PLC , UAL stock has plummeted by 41 % to 168 from 285 .
The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again , as they did in 1982 when Occidental Petroleum Co. rescued them with a $ 4 billion takeover of Cities Service .
In the meantime , the question faced by investors is : What is UAL stock worth ?
The short answer , on a fundamental basis , is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ 135 and $ 150 a share .
That 's based on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10 times UAL earnings , which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ 16 a share this year .
Airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio -- which is currently about 13 times earnings .
That 's because airline earnings , like those of auto makers , have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy .
That analysis matches up with stock traders ' reports that , despite the huge drop in the stock , UAL has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings .
So anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover , and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event .
One analyst , who asked not to be identified , said he believes that the UAL pilots and management can put together a bid `` in the $ 225 area , '' but that it could take three to four months to close .
At that level , and given the uncertainty , he believes UAL stock should trade closer to
Other observers note that UAL 's board , having accepted a bid of $ 300 a share , might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal .
By that logic , the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months , even though the eventual price might be higher .
Investment bankers following UAL agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years , and are n't likely to stop , having come so close to success .
The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ 200 million , and to commit $ 200 million from their retirement funds .
On Friday , they also persuaded the UAL flight attendants to join them .
However , investment bankers say that banks are n't likely to lend the almost $ 5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17 % in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Corp. in July .
Banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk , that is , subordinate to the bank debt in any deal .
That way , they figure , someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work , because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs .
Banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union leader .
That leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ 1 billion -- far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone .
One obstacle to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership .
Investors such as Marvin Davis of Los Angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they , not the pilots , must have control .
One way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders .
The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions , using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking .
But it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders .
The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied .
In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline , starting with one for $ 240 a share from Mr. Davis , the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company , depending on appraisal methods and assumptions .
Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark , First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $ 250 to $ 344 a share based on UAL 's results for the 12 months ending last June 30 , but only $ 235 to $ 266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989 .
First Boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection .
Using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios , First Boston estimated UAL 's value at $ 248 to $ 287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections ; $ 237 to $ 275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA ; $ 98 to $ 121 under an adverse labor settlement , and $ 229 to $ 270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike .
And using liquidation value assuming the sale of all UAL assets , First Boston estimated the airline is worth $ 253 to $ 303 a share .
Unfortunately , all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month .
American Airlines parent AMR and USAir Group , both subject to takeover efforts themselves , have each warned of declining results .
Some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots .
The deal has , as one takeover expert puts it , `` so many moving parts .
I do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving . ''
In addition to the need for another cash equity investor , the other moving parts include : the pilots themselves , who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike ; the machinists union , the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal ; and regulators in Washington , whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt .
In the meantime , the arbs are bleeding .
Wall Street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own UAL stock and options equal to as many as 6.5 million shares , or about 30 % of the total outstanding .
Frank Gallagher , an analyst with Phoenix Capital Corp. in New York , estimates that the arbs paid an average of about $ 280 a share for their UAL positions .
That would indicate that the arbs have paper losses on UAL alone totalling $ 725 million .

Eastern Enterprises , bolstered by improved tonnages in its marine-shipping unit , had a narrower third-quarter net loss of $ 1.1 million , or five cents a share .
Last year , Eastern had a quarter loss of $ 1.7 million , or eight cents a share .
Quarter revenue rose 44 % to $ 160.1 million from $ 111.2 million a year ago .
The Weston , Mass. , utilities and marine-transport concern said results for the third quarter , usually a money-losing one because of the seasonality of the gas business , were also aided by higher gas sales and the May 1989 acquisition of Water Products Company .
For the nine months , Eastern had net income of $ 41.8 million , or $ 1.80 a share , up 23 % from $ 33.9 million or $ 1.46 a share a year ago .
Revenue grew 24 % to $ 614.5 million from $ 497.1 million .
Convex Computer Corp. , continuing its rapid growth while other computer companies falter , reported an 87 % increase in third-quarter net income from a year earlier and a 50 % increase in revenue .

Revenue was $ 111.9 million , up 50 % from $ 74.8 million .
Convex makes supercomputers that sell for up to $ 2 million and has an installed base of more than 550 systems and 340 customers world-wide .
During the third quarter , it said , it won several significant contracts , including a five-year contract with the National Institutes of Health valued at an estimated $ 8 million .
Earlier this month , Convex made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems .
The new products allow customers to add Convex machines to established systems made by other manufacturers , which `` opens up a phenomenal market for us , '' said Robert J. Paluck , Convex 's chairman , president and chief executive .
Convex also recently agreed to use Posix , a standard for the computer language called UNIX .
Posix is one of three or four versions of UNIX , but it is increasingly required by the federal government as it tries to standardize its computer systems .
Most other supercomputer manufacturers have yet to adopt the Posix standard , Mr. Paluck said , adding that they prefer to maintain proprietary systems that lock in customers .
`` They want a lobster trap -- once you get in , you ca n't get out , '' he said .
But the customer does n't want that . ''
Convex closed in over-the-counter trading on Friday at $ 15.375 a share , down 12.5 cents .
Troubled Saatchi & Saatchi Co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units , with potential suitors including Interpublic Group , but has rejected them , people familiar with the company said .
Industry executives said Interpublic approached Saatchi in August about buying its Campbell-Mithun-Esty unit , but was turned down by Chairman Maurice Saatchi .
More recently , Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi 's smaller communications companies -- identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed , they said .
Interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer , Philip Geier Jr. , made the pitches in visits to Mr. Saatchi in London , the executives said .
A Saatchi spokesman declined to comment about Interpublic .
But the spokesman confirmed that Saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its Campbell-Mithun and Rowland units .
He added , `` We have no intention of selling either business . ''
Interpublic declined comment .
The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history .
Takeover speculation has been rife , its consulting business is on the block , and its largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , has said it 's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring .
Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company , and their outlook , at least for the short term , is bleak .
In the midst of the current turmoil , Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses .
It named a new chief executive officer , former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus .
It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel , head of Saatchi 's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit , to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi .
And last week , people close to Saatchi said Maurice Saatchi and his brother , Charles , would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged .
But Saatchi 's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses .
While Saatchi 's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts , its smaller businesses are quite attractive .
Campbell-Mithun-Esty , for example , has had big problems at its New York office , but offers strong offices in other areas of the country , including Minneapolis and Chicago .
That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy New York presence .
While there would be some client conflicts , they would n't be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi 's other agencies . -RRB-
Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network : It has billings of about $ 850 million and blue-chip clients including General Mills , and Dow Brands .
Rowland , meanwhile , has expanded aggressively , and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm , according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms .
It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic , one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own .
Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall , which has the Mercedes account and which has been attempting to buy itself back ; and Howard Marlboro , a sports and event marketing firm .
Despite Saatchi 's firm stand against selling its ad units , U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units .
Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , in a recent interview , said he might sell `` a marginal agency or office . ''
Analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses .
Prudential 's Final Four
Prudential Insurance Co. of America said it selected four agencies to pitch its $ 60 million to $ 70 million account .
In addition to Backer Spielvogel Bates , a Saatchi unit that has handled the account since 1970 , the other agencies include Lowe Marschalk , a unit of the Lowe Group ; Grey Advertising ; and WPP Group 's Scali , McCabe , Sloves agency .
All agencies are New York-based .
A spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm , based in Newark , N.J. , said it hopes to make a decision within three to four months .
Jamaica Fires Back
The Jamaica Tourist Board , in the wake of Young & Rubicam 's indictment on charges that it bribed Jamaican officials to win the account in 1981 , released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident .
The memo attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency , which pleaded innocent to the charges .
Among other things , the memo contends that Young & Rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation would n't uncover any information that would `` embarrass the government of Jamaica or the Jamaica Tourist Board . ''
It also contends that Young & Rubicam never told the tourist board about its relationship with Ad Ventures , a Jamaican firm hired by the agency .
The U.S. indictment charges Ad Ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then-minister of tourism .
The memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement Thursday that it would no longer handle the $ 5 million to $ 6 million account .
The agency declined comment , but said it will continue work until a new agency is chosen .

AYER TALKS : N W Ayer 's president and chief executive officer , Jerry J. Siano , said the agency is holding `` conversations '' about acquiring Zwiren Collins Karo & Trusk , a midsized Chicago agency , but a deal is n't yet close to being completed .
WHO'S NEWS : John Wells , 47 , former president and chief executive of N W Ayer 's Chicago office , was named management director and director of account services at WPP Group 's J. Walter Thompson agency in Chicago .
Shelly Lazarus , 42 , was named president and chief operating officer of Ogilvy & Mather Direct , the direct mail division of WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather agency .
Grand Metropolitan PLC , the United Kingdom food and beverage group that owns Pillsbury Inc. of the U.S. , announced a reshuffling of board-level executive duties intended to fit the company 's recent expansion .
David Nash , formerly group finance director at Cadbury Schweppes PLC , will become Grand Met 's first group finance director in January .
In a statement , Grand Met said its recent `` growth and wider geographic spread '' made it necessary to create the new position .
The company also reassigned several executive responsibilities .
David Tagg , formerly in charge of gambling operations , was appointed chief executive for retailing and property .
Peter Cawdron , group strategy development director , and Bill Shardlow , group personnel director , will become part of the board 's management committee .
David Baltimore , who has just been named president of Rockefeller University , already knows what it 's like to go through life with `` Nobel laureate '' appended to one 's name .
He is currently experiencing what it 's like to have the phrase , `` under investigation for scientific fraud , '' also attached to his name .
The Nobel committee made the first addition ; John Dingell 's congressional committee created the second .
Both of Dr. Baltimore 's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious Rockefeller research institution .
It came to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore 's impending appointment .
They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore 's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee , which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore .
Readers of these columns -LRB- `` The Science Police , '' May 15 -RRB- will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee 's larger investigation , which touched MIT , Tufts , Duke , the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere .
Rep. Dingell even managed to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper .
Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that receive its funding , the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore 's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron , whose behavior reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era .
This well may be the first time that the venerable Rockefeller University has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in American science .
John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore , animal-rights activists do $ 3.5 million of damage to labs at the U.Cal-Davis , Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows , Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court to thwart biotech experiments , and Dutch-elm-disease researcher Gary Strobel 's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for `` violating '' EPA rules .
Scientists are mistaken who still think that the anti-science movement in this country is n't their concern or that a David Baltimore could have somehow placated a John Dingell .
Mr. Dingell , by the way , has decreed another NIH investigation of the Baltimore paper , adding to several previous investigations .
Something other than what most scientists would recognize as the truth is being sought here . -RRB-
Fortunately , there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of speaking out .
David Hubel , a Nobel laureate at Harvard , has taken the lead in defending research with animals , as has Dr. Michael DeBakey .
NASA defended itself vigorously and successfully against a Rifkin suit to block the Galileo launch .
Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good , today it is also about power .
In a media-linked world , scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work , but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content , funding and goals of that work .
When a David Baltimore -- or the next target -- decides it is better to stand up to these forces , his fellow scientists would do well to recognize what is fundamentally at stake , and offer their public support .
Wisconsin Toy Co. said it definitively agreed to acquire closely held Everything 's a Dollar Inc. of Virginia Beach , Va. , for stock currently valued at about $ 4.7 million .
The Milwaukee toy retailer said the agreement calls for Everything 's a Dollar holders to receive for their holdings a total of 354,600 newly issued Wisconsin Toy shares .
Wisconsin Toy currently has about 4.7 million shares outstanding .
A company official said Arthur Borie , until January chief operating officer of Pic 'N Save Inc. , will buy a 20 % stake in the new Wisconsin Toy subsidiary , and will act as head of Everything 's a Dollar .
Wisconsin Toy has 71 retail stores , primarily in discount settings .
Everything 's a Dollar operates 60 specialty-retail stores .
While welcoming Nicholas McInnes 's Sept. 18 letter offering corrections to your `` World-Wide Tax Revolution '' table -LRB- editorial page , Aug. 29 -RRB- , I am surprised that he neglected other errors that , for some of us , strike close to home .
As a Channel Islander , I was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of `` 86 countries with an income tax . ''
Despite a history of heated local debate on the topic , my passport clearly reads `` British citizen . ''
Whether Mr. McInnes 's oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander 's benign neglect is a question my fellow Channel Islanders -LRB- and friends on the Isle of Man -RRB- will continue to ponder .
Roland J. Hawkins , chairman of Jet Vacations Inc. , was elected to the board of this cruise line .
The board expands to seven members .
, under OMB Director Richard Darman 's formulation that `` if it looks like a duck , walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it 's a duck . ''
George Bush is quite clear : No new ducks .
But what about all those non-duck ducks flapping over Washington ?
We see a whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the American economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities .
Federal child care -LRB- quack -RRB- .
The Clean Air bill -LRB- quack -RRB- .
The disabled-workers bill -LRB- quack , quack -RRB- .
The Bush White House is breeding non-duck ducks the same way the Nixon White House did : It hops on an issue that is unopposable -- cleaner air , better treatment of the disabled , better child care .
It comes up with a toned-down version of a Democratic proposal .
The bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches helplessly , wondering where all the `` unexpected '' costs came from .
Consider , for instance , the very fat fowl known as federalized child care .
The President came up with a good bill , but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched on Capitol Hill .
It would create 38,000 local day-care commissions , answerable to the Department of Health and Human Services .
They 'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day , and they 'd regulate the storage facilities .
The initial costs are said to be in the $ 2 billion a year range , but that 's only the beginning .
New entitlements tend to grow , creating a rationale for new taxes .
The administration claims that its Clean Air bill will cost businesses between $ 14 billion and $ 19 billion annually , but economist Michael Evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ 60 billion a year range .
The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways .
For example , the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants .
So instead of building more efficient modern plants , utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants .
The money spent on scrubbers is diverted from planned research on new , cleaner technology .
The bill also imposes the California auto-emissions standards on all cars nationwide , as if a car registered in Big Sky , Montana , needed to be as clean as one driven in Los Angeles .
Proponents of the nationwide standards say the cost for car buyers would be about $ 500 per car .
Other analysts say that estimate is low .
Nobody knows how many billions of dollars the Americans With Disabilities Act will cost , because nobody knows what the bill entails .
It is an intentionally vague document that will create a wave of litigation .
Judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts .
Lawyers will benefit .
Private companies , and ultimately their customers , will end up footing the huge bill .
The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions .
All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists , some of whom worked in the Reagan administration to lift this burden from the American people , states and local governments .
Running for President in 1980 and 1988 , George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s .
In fact , during last year 's campaign , the entire nation constantly heard Mr. Bush tout his accomplishments as head of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief .
`` Government continues to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of American business , '' the vice president declared when he was head of the task force .
But with the impending passage of these new programs , Mr. Bush will surely be sending many people hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped cut back .
By 1986 , the number of federal regulators was down to about 103,000 .
Then it turned up , and by one estimate the number will be up to about 109,000 regulators by next year .
Holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the Bush presidency .
We would have thought by now , though , that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation is n't the only way to slow down an economy .
It is merely the most obvious .
What is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well-intentioned public programs often backfire .
But while they are unloading these burdens , the United States is close to creating three more big ones .
The Bush administration ought to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non-duck ducks .
Confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for September , due for release tomorrow , fail to show a substantial improvement from July and August 's near-record deficits .
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week .
But analysts reckon underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his Mansion House speech last Thursday .
This has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to 16 % from their current 15 % level to defend the pound , economists and foreign exchange market analysts say .
`` The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side , '' said Chris Dillow , senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute .
`` If there is another bad trade number , there could be an awful lot of pressure , '' noted Simon Briscoe , U.K. economist for Midland Montagu , a unit of Midland Bank PLC .
Forecasts for the trade figures range widely , but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the # 2 billion -LRB- $ 3.2 billion -RRB- deficit in the current account reported for August .
The August deficit and the # 2.2 billion gap registered in July are topped only by the # 2.3 billion deficit of October 1988 .
Sanjay Joshi , European economist at Baring Brothers & Co. , said there is no sign that Britain 's manufacturing industry is transforming itself to boost exports .
At the same time , he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports , given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows .
He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only # 1.8 billion in September .
However , Mr. Dillow said he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports .
Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August 's unexpected decline , the deficit could narrow to as little as # 1.3 billion .
Mr. Briscoe , who also forecasts a # 1.3 billion current account gap , warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling , the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions .
Nevertheless , he noted , `` No one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position '' in the pound .
Meanwhile , overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded .
In his Mansion House speech , Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect .
U.K. base rates are at their highest level in eight years .
But consumer expenditure data released Friday do n't suggest that the U.K. economy is slowing that quickly .
The figures show that spending rose 0.1 % in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8 % from a year ago .
This compares with a 1.6 % rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4 % increase from the second quarter of 1988 .
Mr. Dillow said the data show the economy `` is still quite strong , '' but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises .
Certainly , the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further .
Thursday , he reminded his audience that the government `` can not allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness . ''
Analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary .
And , they warn , any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow .
Sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. Lawson 's promise Friday .
In European trading it declined to $ 1.5890 and 2.9495 marks from $ 1.5940 and 2.9429 marks late Thursday .
Economists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks , the government will be forced to increase rates to 16 % , both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged .
Friday 's Market Activity
The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated .
Foreign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange , which has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points .
Currency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve .
Late in the New York trading day , the dollar was quoted at 1.8578 marks , up from 1.8470 marks late Thursday in New York .
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 142.43 yen , up from 141.70 yen in New York late Thursday .
In Tokyo on Monday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.95 yen , up from Friday 's Tokyo close of 141.35 yen .
On the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery settled at $ 367.30 an ounce , up 20 cents .
Estimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces .
In early trading in Hong Kong Monday , gold was quoted at $ 366.50 an ounce .
East Rock Partners Limited Partnership said it proposed to acquire A.P. Green Industries Inc. for $ 40 a share .
In an Oct. 19 letter to A.P. Green 's board , East Rock said the offer is subject to the signing of a merger agreement by no later than Oct. 31 .
The letter , attached to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , said the approval is also contingent upon obtaining satisfactory financing .
An A.P. Green official declined to comment on the filing .
The $ 40-a-share proposal values the company at about $ 106.6 million .
A.P. Green currently has 2,664,098 shares outstanding .
Its stock closed at $ 38 , up $ 1.875 , in national over-the-counter trading .
The company is a Mexico , Mo. , maker of refractory products .
East Rock also said in the filing that it boosted its stake in A.P. Green to 8.7 % .
It now holds 233,000 A.P. Green common shares , including 30,000 shares bought last Thursday for $ 35.50 to $ 36.50 a share .
New York-based John Kuhns and Robert MacDonald control East Rock Partners Inc. , the sole general partner of East Rock Partners L.P .
The sole limited partner of the partnership is Westwood Brick Lime Inc. , an indirect subsidiary of Westwood Group Inc .

Freight rates , declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation , are bottoming out , turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation .
Trucking , shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases , scheduled for this fall or early next year , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport .
Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years .
That 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad .
`` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said Clifford Sayre , director of logistics at Du Pont Co .
Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year .
Only 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease , compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years .
`` This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said Bernard LaLonde , a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus .
The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation .
Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill .
Shippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 .
But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates .
`` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. LaLonde .
`` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years .
Transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy . ''
Robert Delaney , a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said `` We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions .
Now we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor .
You 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . ''
Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers .
`` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said Gerard McCullough , lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Less-than-truckload companies , which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer , discounted away a 4.7 % rate increase implemented last April .
The carriers were competing fiercely for market share .
Railroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks .
An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . ''
Consolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases .
Truckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros .
And `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said .
Air-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month .
And Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years .
Such rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan .
Ship companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years .
Some bulk shipping rates have increased `` 3 % to 4 % in the past few months , '' said Salomon 's Mr. Lloyd .
And ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates .
Carriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels .
Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % , effective next April .
MGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares .
The Beverly Hills , Calif.-based company said it would have 26.9 million common shares outstanding after the offering .
The hotel and Gaming company said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will lead the underwriters .
Proceeds from the sale will be used for remodeling and refurbishing projects , as well as for the planned MGM Grand and theme park .
Bob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination .
Mr. Stone thought the discipline was unfair ; he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons .
Unable to persuade the manager to change his decision , he went to a `` company court '' for a hearing .
At the scheduled time , Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked .
After the three members of the court introduced themselves , the chairman of the panel said : `` Go ahead and tell us what happened .
We may ask questions as you go along , or we may wait until the end . ''
No lawyers or tape recorders were present .
The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists , one of whom knew Mr. Stone 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture .
Over a cup of coffee , Mr. Stone told his story .
He talked about 20 minutes .
When he was through , the court members asked many questions , then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses .
The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks .
Bob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real .
It happened at Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles .
The court is called the Management Appeals Committee , or just `` MAC , '' and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year .
Alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis , the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis , a General Electric plant in Columbia , Md. , or a number of other companies .
These firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what I call corporate due process .
Although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies -- perhaps 40 to 60 -- it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry .
In the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are likely to adopt it .
Corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons .
It reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees , with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations .
It helps to keep out unions .
It increases employee commitment to the company , with all that means for efficiency and quality control .
What must your management team do to establish corporate due process ?
Here are four key steps :
1 . Make sure you have a strong personnel department .
It must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates , else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases .
At Polaroid , the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year ; the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages .
At TWA , the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year , only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists .
At Citicorp , the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel 's skill in complaint-resolution .
In a typical year , up to 20 % of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment .
In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle .
2 . Formally or informally , train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach .
See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the `` law '' governing company courts and adjudicators .
Coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately .
In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen .
In the 15 companies I studied , reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 % .
3 . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator .
A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support .
An adjudicator system -- that is , an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy .
International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach .
4 . Make your due-process system visible .
It wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it .
Most managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints .
On the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists .
Smith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs .
Naturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it .
At IBM , the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive .
Federal Express goes further in this respect than any company I know of with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale , chief executive and chief operating officer , respectively , sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases .

Tokyo stocks closed higher in active trading Friday , marking the fourth consecutive daily gain since Monday 's sharp fall .
London shares closed moderately lower in thin trading .
At Tokyo , the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 112.16 points to 35486.38 .
The index advanced 266.66 points Thursday .
In early trading in Tokyo Monday , the Nikkei index rose 101.98 points to 35588.36 .
Friday 's volume on the First Section was estimated at one billion shares , up from 862 million Thursday .
Winners outpaced losers , 572 to 368 , while 181 issues remained unchanged .
With investors relieved at the overnight gain in New York stocks , small-lot buying orders streamed into the market from early morning , making traders believe the market was back to normal .
The Nikkei , which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening , surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking .
`` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session .
The Tokyo Stock Price Index -LRB- Topix -RRB- of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained 22.78 points Thursday , was up 14.06 points , or 0.53 % , at 2679.72 .
The Second Section index , which rose 15.72 points Thursday , was up 11.88 points , or 0.32 % , to close at 3717.46 .
Volume in the second section was estimated at 30 million shares , up from 28 million Thursday .
In turmoil caused by the previous Friday 's plunge in New York stocks , the Nikkei marked a sharp 647.33-point fall Monday .
But the Nikkei fell an overall 1.8 % in value that day compared with Wall Street 's far sharper 6.9 % drop on Oct. 13 .
The Tokyo market 's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the Friday plunge and realized these problems were unique to New York stocks and not directly related to Tokyo .
The Nikkei continued to gain for the rest of the week , adding 1017.69 points in four days -- more than erasing Monday 's losses .
But further major advances on the Nikkei are n't foreseen this week by market observers .
Investors are still waiting to see how the U.S. government will decide on interest rates and how the dollar will be stabilized .
Some high-priced issues made a comeback Friday .
Pioneer surged 450 yen -LRB- $ 3.16 -RRB- to 6,050 yen -LRB- $ 42.60 -RRB- .
Kyocera advanced 80 yen to 5,440 .
Fanuc gained 100 to 7,580 .
Breweries attracted investors because of their land property holdings that could figure in development or other plans , traders said .
Sapporo gained 80 to 1,920 and Kirin added 60 to 2,070 .
Housings , constructions and pharmaceuticals continued to be bought following Thursday 's gains because of strong earnings outlooks .
Daiwa House gained 50 to 2,660 .
Misawa Homes was up 20 at 2,960 .
Kajima advanced 40 to 2,120 and Ohbayashi added 50 to 1,730 .
Fujisawa added 80 to 2,010 and Mochida advanced 230 to 4,400 .
London share prices were influenced largely by declines on Wall Street and weakness in the British pound .
The key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2179.1 , above its intraday low of 2176.9 , but off the day 's high of 2189 .
The index finished 2.4 % under its close of 2233.9 the previous Friday , although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of Wall Street 's fall .
London was weak throughout Friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September .
The FT-SE 100 largely remained within an 11-point range establshed within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower .
The FT 30-share index closed 11.0 points lower at 1761.0 .
Volume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares , the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday 's 387.4 million shares .
Dealers said the day 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark , and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward Thursday .
They added that market-makers were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market Thursday in their quest to cover internal shortages of FT-SE 100 shares .
Interest may remain limited into tomorrow 's U.K. trade figures , which the market will be watching closely to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in the previous two months .
The key corporate news of the day was that British Airways decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for UAL Corp. , the parent of United Airlines .
British Airways rose initially after announcing its withdrawal from the UAL deal .
Dealers said they viewed the initial # 390-million -LRB- $ 622 million -RRB- outlay for a 15 % stake in the airline as a bit much .
Its shares slid in late dealings to close a penny per share lower at 197 pence .
The airline was the most active FT-SE 100 at 8.2 million shares traded .
The next most active top-tier stock was B.A.T Industries , the target of Sir James Goldsmith 's # 13.4 billion bid .
The company gained shareholder approval Thursday to restructure in a bid to fend off the hostile takeover .
Sir James said Thursday night that his plans for the takeover had n't changed .
B.A.T ended the day at 778 , down 5 , on turnover of 7.5 million shares .
Dealers said it was hit by some profit-taking after gains since mid-week .
In other active shares , Trusthouse Forte shed 10 to 294 on volume of 6.4 million shares after a Barclays De Zoete Wedd downgrading , while Hillsdown Holdings , a food products concern , was boosted 2 to 271 after it disclosed it would seek shareholder approval to begin share repurchases .
Elsewhere in Europe , share prices closed higher in Stockholm , Brussels and Milan .
Prices were lower in Frankfurt , Zurich , Paris and Amsterdam .
South African gold stocks closed moderately lower .
Share prices closed higher in Sydney , Taipei , Wellington , Manila , Hong Kong and Singapore and were lower in Seoul .

The U.S. is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives , government officials said .
The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee .
The existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday .
Officials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega .
According to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines .
They said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort .
No notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him .
What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House .
The rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules .
However , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress .
It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad .
A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman , Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama .
The statement added , `` Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government .
Not only does this come close to a violation of law , it violates the trust we have all worked to develop . ''
Sen. Boren said , `` It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future .
I 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee . ''
Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine , the panel 's vice chairman , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . ''
Sen. Boren said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules .
But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress .
Instead , both congressional and administration officials agreed , it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October .
The guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations .
In fact , yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to .
One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life .
But a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S .
Although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt , some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama .
One senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble .
The issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts .
In addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign .
Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation .
Last week , Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups .
The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action .
However , last week Mr. Webster 's two top CIA deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in Panama .
Nevertheless , the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens. Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president .
The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines , without changing the basic assassination ban , to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders .
The new argument over the notification guideline , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed .

MUTUAL FUNDS ARRIVED IN THE U.S. during the Roaring Twenties -LRB- they had been in Britain for a century -RRB- , but they did n't boom until the money market fund was created in the 1970s .
By 1980 , there were more than 100 such funds .
Besides creating a vehicle for investors , money market funds also helped rewrite banking regulations .
The idea was to let small investors , the backbone of the fund business , deal in the money market 's high short-term interest rates .
This had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place .
The now-standard price of $ 1 a share came about by accident .
An early fund had filed a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included a fixed $ 1 price .
It arrived just as the regulator handling such operations was retiring .
His successor approved the $ 1 price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his desk .
When Dreyfus started the first advertising-backed retail fund in February 1974 , it was priced at $ 10 a share -LRB- and reached $ 1 billion in assets in one year . -RRB-
Dreyfus moved to the $ 1 price after the SEC set standards -- an average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper -- that are still the rule .
Keeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience .
Actually , the funds do fluctuate , but beyond the third decimal place .
Rounding-off keeps them at $ 1 .
Eventually , the money funds ' success forced relaxation of curbs on bank interest rates to allow banks to offer competing yields .
The new instrument also introduced many to the industry -- 30 % of fund owners -LRB- there are more than 54 million accounts -RRB- started with a money fund .
Today more than 470 money market funds have total assets exceeding $ 350 billion .

Dreyfus alone has seen its money market funds grow from $ 1 billion in 1975 to closes to $ 15 billion today .
Procter & Gamble Co. and Noxell Corp. said they received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act regarding the proposed $ 1.4 billion merger of Noxell into P&G .
Shareholders of Noxell , of Hunt Valley , Md. , will vote on the merger at a special meeting on Nov. 30 , the companies said .
P&G , Cincinnati , agreed to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock , a total of about 11 million P&G shares .
The transaction would mark the entry of P&G into cosmetics .
The company already markets a wide range of detergents , food , household and health-care products .
Shareholders of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b . H. postponed their formal endorsement of a merger with Daimler-Benz AG until another meeting on Nov. 17 .
The owners of the defense and aerospace concern , which include three regional states , several industrial companies and banks , met Friday to discuss the final terms of the transaction , in which Daimler-Benz will acquire 50.01 % of
But agreement aparently could n't be reached because of opposition from the states of Hamburg and Bremen , which are demanding more influence over the German Airbus operations and a better guarantee against job losses in the troubled Northern German region .
The two states and the state of Bavaria still hold a majority in MBB , but their stake will fall to around 30 % after Daimler-Benz acquires its stake in the concern .

The government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross national product this week in a report that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation .
The consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain , down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , according to MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York .
But inflation , as measured by the GNP deflator in Thursday 's report , is expected to rise only 3.5 % , down from 4.6 % in the second quarter .
`` Inflation could be a real surprise , '' said Samuel D. Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. , in Chicago .
`` If that gets people excited , it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he added .
The week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales , September durable goods orders as well as September personal income , personal consumption and the saving rate .
Most are expected to fall below previous-month levels .
Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession .
In addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter .
The recent one-day , 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported .
`` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says Michael K. Evans , president of Evans Economics Inc. , Washington .
The economy , he noted , moves the market , not vice versa .
On the other hand , Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP . ''
His estimate of 3.3 % for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate .
